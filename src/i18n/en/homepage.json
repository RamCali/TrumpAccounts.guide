Every eligible U.S. citizen child born between 2025–2028 can receive a $1,000 federal pilot deposit. The money is invested in S&P 500 index funds during the \"growth phase\" (birth to 18), then converts to a traditional IRA. Parents and employers can contribute up to $5,000/year.",

  "faq.q2": "How do I open a Trump Account for my child?",
  "faq.a2": "File IRS Form 4547 with your 2025 tax return (due April 15, 2026). You can also use the trumpaccounts.gov portal starting mid-2026, or mail the form. You'll need your child's Social Security number. The IRS will send activation info starting May 2026.",
  "faq.a2cta": "Step-by-step guide",
  "faq.q3": "Who qualifies for the $1,000 federal deposit?",
  "faq.a3": "U.S. citizen children born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028 who have a valid Social Security number. There are no income restrictions — every qualifying child gets the same $1,000. Children older than this can still open a Trump Account but won't receive the pilot deposit.",
  "faq.a3cta": "Check your child's eligibility",
  "faq.q4": "Is this different from a 529 plan?",
  "faq.a4": "Yes. A 529 is for education expenses with tax-free withdrawals. A Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA at 18 — the money can be used for anything. Different tax treatment, different limits, different investment options. Most families should use both.",
