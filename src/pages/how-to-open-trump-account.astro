      </div>

      <p>
        Opening a Trump Account for your child takes about 10 minutes if you already have their Social Security number.
        The process starts with IRS Form 4547 and finishes when you choose a financial institution and an eligible index fund.
      </p>

      <h2 id="before-you-start">Before You Start: What You Need</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your child's Social Security number (SSN)</strong> — must be issued before the election is made</li>
        <li><strong>Your SSN</strong> (the authorized individual — usually a parent or guardian)</li>
        <li><strong>Child's date of birth</strong> — determines pilot deposit eligibility</li>
        <li><strong>Your 2025 tax return</strong> (if filing with return) or access to trumpaccounts.gov</li>
      </ul>

      <CalloutBox type="tip" title="No income restrictions">
        <p>Unlike Roth IRAs, there are <strong>no income limits</strong> for Trump Accounts. Every U.S. citizen child with a valid SSN qualifies, regardless of family income.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2 id="step-1">Step 1: Get IRS Form 4547</h2>

      <p>
        Form 4547 is the official election form for Trump Accounts.
        It's a one-page form that tells the IRS you want to open a Trump Account for your child.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Where to get it:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-4547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS.gov — About Form 4547</a> (official PDF download)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4547.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct PDF link</a></li>
        <li>Your tax software (TurboTax, H&R Block, etc.) should include it for 2025 returns</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i4547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form 4547 Instructions</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="step-2">Step 2: Fill Out the Form</h2>

      <p>Form 4547 asks for:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Your information</strong> — name, SSN, address (you're the "authorized individual")</li>
        <li><strong>Child's information</strong> — name, SSN, date of birth</li>
        <li><strong>Election to open account</strong> — check the box to elect a Trump Account</li>
        <li><strong>Pilot program election</strong> — if your child was born 2025–2028, elect the $1,000 deposit</li>
      </ol>

      <CalloutBox type="irs-quote" title="What the IRS says (Form 4547 Instructions)">
        <p>"The fastest, safest, and easiest way to make the election is to file Form 4547 with your current-year e-filed tax return."</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <div class="rounded-lg border border-mint-400/30 bg-mint-400/10 p-4">
        <p class="mb-1 font-semibold text-mint-300">In plain English:</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-mint-200">E-file your taxes and include Form 4547. That's it. Don't overthink it.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="step-3">Step 3: Submit the Form</h2>

      <p>You have three options:</p>

      <h3>Option A: File with your 2025 tax return (recommended)</h3>
      <p>
        Attach Form 4547 when you file your 2025 federal tax return, due April 15, 2026.
        E-filing is the fastest and most reliable method.
        Most tax software will prompt you to complete this form.
      </p>

      <h3>Option B: Use the trumpaccounts.gov online portal</h3>
      <p>
        Starting mid-2026, you can submit Form 4547 through the
        <a href="https://trumpaccounts.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trumpaccounts.gov</a> online portal.
        This option is best if you've already filed your 2025 taxes.
      </p>

      <h3>Option C: Mail it</h3>
      <p>
        If you can't e-file, you can mail Form 4547 to the IRS address listed at
        <a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/where-to-file-paper-tax-returns-with-or-without-a-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS.gov/PaperReturns</a>.
        This is the slowest option.
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="warning" title="Already filed your 2025 taxes?">
        <p>You can file an amended return (Form 1040-X) with Form 4547 attached. Or wait for the trumpaccounts.gov portal in mid-2026.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2 id="step-4">Step 4: Wait for Activation</h2>

      <p>After you submit Form 4547:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>May 2026:</strong> The Treasury Department (or its agent) sends you activation information</li>
        <li><strong>You'll complete an authentication process</strong> to verify your identity</li>
        <li><strong>Then you choose a financial institution</strong> (trustee) to hold the account</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="step-5">Step 5: Choose a Financial Institution & Fund</h2>

      <p>
        Once activated, you'll pick an approved Trump Account trustee.
        Major brokerages are expected to participate, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fidelity</li>
        <li>Vanguard</li>
        <li>Charles Schwab</li>
        <li>BlackRock (iShares)</li>
        <li>State Street (SPDR)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your account must be invested in a <strong>mutual fund or ETF that tracks the S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index</strong>.
        You cannot pick individual stocks or sector funds.
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Pick the lowest expense ratio">
        <p>All eligible funds track similar indexes. The main difference is fees. Look for expense ratios under 0.05%. Our <a href="/calculators/fund-expense-tracker">Fund Expense Tracker</a> compares all eligible options.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2 id="step-6">Step 6: Start Contributing</h2>

      <p>After July 4, 2026, you can start adding money:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual limit:</strong> $5,000/year (indexed for inflation after 2027)</li>
        <li><strong>Employer contributions:</strong> Up to $2,500/year per employee (tax-free under §128)</li>
        <li><strong>No minimum contribution</strong> — contribute whatever you can afford</li>
        <li><strong>Contributions are after-tax</strong> (like a Roth, you don't get a deduction)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Can I open a Trump Account right now?</h3>
      <p>
        You can file the election (Form 4547) right now with your 2025 tax return.
        The account itself doesn't become active until July 4, 2026.
      </p>

      <h3>What if I already filed my 2025 taxes without Form 4547?</h3>
      <p>
        File an amended return (Form 1040-X) with Form 4547 attached,
        or use the trumpaccounts.gov portal when it launches mid-2026.
      </p>

      <h3>Can both parents file Form 4547?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Only one authorized individual can make the election per child.
        If both parents file, the first received is processed.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need a specific brokerage?</h3>
      <p>
        You need to use a financial institution approved as a Trump Account trustee.
        Major brokerages like Fidelity, Vanguard, and Schwab are expected to participate.
      </p>

      <h3>What if my child doesn't have an SSN yet?</h3>
      <p>
        You must obtain an SSN before filing Form 4547. For newborns, you can request an SSN
        at the hospital when you apply for the birth certificate. Processing typically takes 2–6 weeks.
      </p>
