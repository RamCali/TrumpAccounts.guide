    question: 'Is a Trump Account the same as a 529 plan?',
    answer: 'No. While both help families save for children, a 529 is for education expenses with tax-free growth, while a Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA at age 18 with tax-deferred growth and a $1,000 federal seed deposit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I open a Trump Account for my existing child (born before 2025)?',
    answer: 'Yes! Any U.S. citizen child under 18 can have a Trump Account opened for them. However, only children born between Jan 1, 2025 and Dec 31, 2028 receive the $1,000 federal pilot deposit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I make too much money?',
    answer: 'There are <strong>no income restrictions</strong> for Trump Accounts. Unlike Roth IRAs, any family can open and contribute regardless of income.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I withdraw the money before age 18?',
    answer: 'No. Withdrawals before age 18 are not permitted except for rollovers to another Trump Account, return of excess contributions, or in the event of the child\'s death.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are Trump Accounts savings accounts?',
    answer: 'No. Despite the nickname "Trump savings accounts," they are <strong>investment accounts</strong>. The money goes into S&P 500 index funds — not a bank savings account. Over 18 years, the difference is dramatic: $1,000 in a bank at 4% APY grows to about $2,026, while $1,000 in a Trump Account at the S&P 500\'s historical 10% average grows to roughly $5,560.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I open a Trump Account for my baby or any child?',
    answer: 'Yes. Any U.S. citizen child under 18 with a valid SSN qualifies — babies, toddlers, kids, and teenagers. "Trump baby accounts" and "child Trump accounts" all refer to the same program under IRC Section 530A.',

      <h1>What Are Trump Accounts for Kids? A Complete Guide for Parents</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>What is a Trump Account?</strong> A Trump Account is a new type of tax-advantaged investment account created by the
        <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)</strong>, signed into law on July 4, 2025.
        Officially established under <strong>IRC Section 530A</strong>, Trump Accounts are designed to give every
        American child a financial head start.
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="tip" title="The short version">
        <p>The government deposits $1,000 for every child born 2025–2028. Parents can add up to $5,000/year. It grows tax-deferred in S&P 500 funds until age 18, then converts to a traditional IRA.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2>How Trump Accounts Work</h2>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Federal Seed Money:</strong> Children born January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2028 receive a one-time <strong>$1,000 pilot deposit</strong> from the federal government.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Contributions:</strong> Parents (or anyone) can contribute up to <strong>$5,000/year</strong> in after-tax dollars. This limit is indexed for inflation starting in 2027.</li>
        <li><strong>Employer Contributions:</strong> Employers can contribute up to <strong>$2,500/year per employee</strong>, tax-free under IRC §128. This counts toward the $5,000 cap.</li>
        <li><strong>Investment:</strong> All funds must be invested in mutual funds or ETFs tracking the <strong>S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index</strong>. Expense ratios are capped at 0.1%.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Phase:</strong> From birth to age 18, the account grows tax-deferred. No withdrawals are allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>At Age 18:</strong> The Trump Account automatically converts to a <strong>traditional IRA</strong> with standard IRA rules.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Who Is Eligible?</h2>

      <p>To open a Trump Account, the child must be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>U.S. citizen</strong></li>
        <li>Have a valid <strong>Social Security Number (SSN)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Under 18</strong> at the end of the election year</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are <strong>no income restrictions</strong> — any family can participate regardless of how much they earn.</p>

      <CalloutBox type="info" title="$1,000 pilot deposit eligibility">
        <p>Only children born between <strong>January 1, 2025</strong> and <strong>December 31, 2028</strong> qualify for the $1,000 federal pilot deposit. Children born outside this window can still open a Trump Account but won't receive the deposit.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2>How to Open a Trump Account</h2>

      <p>There are three ways to establish a Trump Account:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>With your tax return:</strong> Include <strong>IRS Form 4547</strong> (Trump Account Election(s)) with your 2025 tax return, due April 15, 2026.</li>
        <li><strong>Online portal:</strong> Through <a href="https://trumpaccounts.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trumpaccounts.gov</a> (expected to launch mid-2026).</li>
        <li><strong>By mail:</strong> Send Form 4547 to the IRS.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Dell Foundation Pledge</h2>

      <p>Michael and Susan Dell pledged <strong>$6.25 billion</strong> — $250 per child under 10 in ZIP codes where the median income is below $150,000. This is in addition to the $1,000 federal pilot deposit.</p>

      <h2>Tax Treatment</h2>

      <p>Trump Accounts use <strong>traditional (tax-deferred) treatment</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contributions are made with <strong>after-tax dollars</strong> (no tax deduction)</li>
        <li>Earnings grow <strong>tax-deferred</strong> during the growth phase</li>
        <li>Withdrawals after age 18 are taxed as <strong>ordinary income</strong></li>
        <li>Before age 59½, a <strong>10% early withdrawal penalty</strong> applies (standard IRA rules)</li>
      </ul>

      <CalloutBox type="irs-quote" title="From IRS Notice 2025-68">
        <p><em>"A Trump Account is a trust created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an eligible beneficiary..."</em></p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Plain English:</strong> It's a savings account your kid owns. You manage it until they turn 18, then it becomes their traditional IRA.</p>
      </CalloutBox>
