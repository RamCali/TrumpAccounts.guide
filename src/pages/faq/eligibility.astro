const questions = [
  { q: 'Do all babies get a Trump Account?', a: 'No. Parents must opt in by filing IRS Form 4547. It is not automatic. All U.S. citizen children under 18 with a valid SSN qualify, but the $1,000 pilot deposit is only for children born January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2028.' },
  { q: 'Is this only for U.S. citizens?', a: 'Yes. The child must be a U.S. citizen with a valid Social Security number. Permanent residents (green card holders) and undocumented families do not qualify.' },
  { q: 'What about children already born before 2025?', a: 'Children born before 2025 can still open a Trump Account (if under 18), but they will not receive the $1,000 federal pilot deposit. They can still receive family and employer contributions of up to $5,000/year.' },
  { q: 'Do adopted children qualify?', a: 'Yes. Adopted children who are U.S. citizens with a valid SSN qualify on the same terms as biological children. The key requirements are citizenship, SSN, and age — not biological relationship.' },
  { q: 'Would low-income families get more money?', a: 'No. Every qualifying child receives the same $1,000 pilot deposit regardless of family income. There are no income-based tiers. However, the Dell Foundation pledge targets children in ZIP codes with median income below $150,000 for an additional $250.' },
  { q: 'Would wealthy families be excluded?', a: 'No. There are no income restrictions for Trump Accounts. Unlike Roth IRAs, there is no income phaseout. Families at any income level can open an account and contribute.' },
  { q: 'What about undocumented families?', a: 'The child must be a U.S. citizen with a valid Social Security number (not an ITIN). If the child is a U.S. citizen but the parent is undocumented, the parent may still be able to file Form 4547 if they have a valid taxpayer identification number.' },
  { q: 'What happens if a child dies?', a: 'Per IRS Notice 2025-68, funds can be distributed upon the death of the account beneficiary. The distribution would go to the estate or designated beneficiary per the account terms.' },
  { q: 'Do U.S. citizens born outside the U.S. qualify?', a: 'Yes. Birth location does not matter. If the child is a U.S. citizen with a valid SSN, they qualify — whether born in Paris, Tokyo, or a U.S. military base overseas. Children born abroad to U.S. citizen parents often acquire citizenship at birth. You will need a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) and an SSN. See our full guide on children born abroad.' },
  { q: 'What happens if a family moves abroad?', a: 'The account can remain open. The child must be a U.S. citizen — living abroad does not disqualify them. However, contributions and withdrawals may be subject to the tax laws of the country of residence.' },
  { q: 'Can a grandparent open a Trump Account?', a: 'The IRS Form 4547 must be filed by an "authorized individual" — generally a parent or legal guardian. Grandparents can contribute to an existing Trump Account, but cannot open one unless they are the legal guardian.' },
  { q: 'Is there an age cutoff for opening an account?', a: 'The child must be under 18 at the end of the calendar year in which the election is made. So a 17-year-old can still open one, but they won\'t have many years of growth before it converts to a traditional IRA at 18.' },
  { q: 'Can I open a Trump Account for my unborn child?', a: 'No. The child must have a valid Social Security number before the election is made. You\'ll need to wait until after birth and after receiving the SSN.' },
