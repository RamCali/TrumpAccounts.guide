const questions = [
  { q: 'Are gains in a Trump Account taxed?', a: 'Not while they grow. Trump Accounts are tax-deferred during the growth phase (birth to 18). Once the account converts to a traditional IRA at age 18, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income — just like any traditional IRA.' },
  { q: 'Is it tax-free growth like a Roth?', a: 'No. A Trump Account is NOT a Roth account. Growth is tax-deferred (like a traditional IRA), meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals. This is one of the most common misconceptions.' },
  { q: 'Are withdrawals taxed?', a: 'Yes. After the account converts to a traditional IRA at age 18, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. If your child withdraws before age 59½, they may also owe a 10% early withdrawal penalty on top of income taxes.' },
  { q: 'Are contributions tax-deductible?', a: 'No. Contributions to a Trump Account are made with after-tax dollars — you do not get a tax deduction. However, employer contributions (up to $2,500/year) are excluded from the employee\'s gross income under IRC §128.' },
  { q: 'Does a Trump Account affect FAFSA?', a: 'The IRS has not yet issued specific guidance on how Trump Accounts interact with FAFSA. Since the account converts to a traditional IRA owned by the child at 18, it could potentially be counted as a student asset. Check with a financial aid advisor for the latest guidance.' },
  { q: 'Does it affect Medicaid eligibility?', a: 'During the growth phase (before 18), the IRS guidance does not specifically address Medicaid impact. Once it becomes a traditional IRA at 18, standard IRA rules apply for Medicaid eligibility determinations, which vary by state.' },
  { q: 'Does it count as income later?', a: 'The account balance itself is not income. Only withdrawals count as taxable income. If your child withdraws $10,000 at age 25, that $10,000 is added to their taxable income for that year.' },
  { q: 'What is the tax rate on withdrawals?', a: 'Withdrawals are taxed at your child\'s ordinary income tax rate in the year they withdraw. An 18-year-old with no other income who withdraws $15,000 would pay very little tax (likely in the 10-12% bracket). Use our Withdrawal Simulator to model specific scenarios.' },
  { q: 'Is there a penalty for withdrawing at 18?', a: 'At age 18, the account converts to a traditional IRA. Withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty plus ordinary income tax. Some exceptions apply (first-time home purchase up to $10,000, qualified education expenses, etc.).' },
  { q: 'Are employer contributions taxed?', a: 'No — that\'s the benefit. Under IRC §128, employer contributions to Trump Accounts (up to $2,500/year per employee) are excluded from the employee\'s gross income. You don\'t pay income tax or payroll tax on them.' },
  { q: 'Can I do a Roth conversion at 18?', a: 'Yes. When the Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA at age 18, your child can convert it to a Roth IRA. They\'d pay income tax on the converted amount that year, but then all future growth and withdrawals would be tax-free. This is often a smart move if they\'re in a low tax bracket at 18.' },
