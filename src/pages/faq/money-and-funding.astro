const questions = [
  { q: 'How much is the federal deposit?', a: 'The federal government deposits $1,000 into Trump Accounts for children born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028. This is a one-time deposit through the pilot program. You must file IRS Form 4547 to claim it.' },
  { q: 'Where does the $1,000 come from?', a: 'It comes from the U.S. Treasury as part of the pilot program established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). It is funded by taxpayer dollars — not a loan, grant, or private donation.' },
  { q: 'How much can I contribute per year?', a: 'Up to $5,000 per year total (after-tax). This limit is indexed for inflation starting in 2027. The $5,000 cap includes all contributions — from parents, grandparents, friends, and employers.' },
  { q: 'Can my employer contribute?', a: 'Yes. Under IRC §128, employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year per employee. These contributions are tax-free to the employee (excluded from gross income). The $2,500 counts toward the $5,000 annual cap.' },
  { q: 'Is the employer limit per child or per employee?', a: 'Per employee. If you have 3 children with Trump Accounts, your employer can still only contribute $2,500 total — not $2,500 per child.' },
  { q: 'Can grandparents contribute?', a: 'Yes. Anyone can contribute to a Trump Account — parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends. All contributions from all sources count toward the single $5,000 annual limit.' },
  { q: 'What is the Dell Foundation $250?', a: 'Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion to provide an additional $250 per child under 10 in ZIP codes where the median household income is below $150,000. This is separate from and in addition to the $1,000 federal deposit.' },
  { q: 'Can I contribute more than $5,000?', a: 'No. The $5,000 annual limit is a hard cap. Excess contributions must be removed and may be subject to a 6% excise tax if not corrected by the tax filing deadline.' },
  { q: 'Are contributions tax-deductible?', a: 'No. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. You do not get a tax deduction for contributing to a Trump Account. However, employer contributions under §128 are excluded from the employee\'s gross income.' },
  { q: 'What if I can only afford $50/month?', a: 'That\'s perfectly fine. There is no minimum contribution. Even $50/month ($600/year) invested in an S&P 500 index fund could grow to roughly $18,000–$22,000 by age 18 (assuming ~8% average annual returns). Use our <a href="/calculators/growth-calculator">Growth Calculator</a> to model your own scenario.' },
  { q: 'Does the $5,000 limit increase with inflation?', a: 'Yes. Starting in 2027, the $5,000 annual contribution limit is indexed for inflation. The IRS will announce adjusted limits each year.' },
  { q: 'Can I contribute in a lump sum or does it have to be monthly?', a: 'Either way. You can contribute a lump sum, monthly, quarterly, or any schedule you prefer — as long as total contributions for the calendar year do not exceed $5,000.' },
