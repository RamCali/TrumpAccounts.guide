    { question: 'Is a Trump Account like a Roth IRA for kids?', answer: 'Not exactly. A Trump Account grows tax-deferred and converts to a traditional IRA (not Roth) at age 18. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. A custodial Roth IRA requires earned income but offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.' },
    { question: 'Can my child have both a Trump Account and a Roth IRA?', answer: 'Yes. At age 18, the Trump Account becomes a traditional IRA. Your child can also open a separate Roth IRA if they have earned income.' },
    { question: 'Which grows more tax-efficiently?', answer: 'Roth IRA wins on tax efficiency — withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. Trump Account withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income (traditional IRA rules). But Trump Accounts don\'t require earned income and come with a $1,000 federal deposit.' },

      <p>
        People often confuse Trump Accounts with Roth IRAs for kids, but they work very differently.
        The biggest difference: Trump Accounts don't require earned income and convert to a <strong>traditional</strong> IRA (not Roth) at 18.

      <h2 id="biggest-difference">The Biggest Difference: Earned Income</h2>

      <p>
        A custodial Roth IRA requires your child to have <strong>earned income</strong> — from a job, babysitting, lawn mowing, etc.
        A 6-month-old baby has no earned income, so a Roth IRA is off the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Trump Account has <strong>no earned income requirement</strong>.
        You can open one for a newborn on day one and start contributing immediately (after July 4, 2026).
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="tip" title="The power move for working teens">
        <p>When your child starts earning money (part-time job, summer work), open a Roth IRA alongside the Trump Account. The Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA at 18, and the Roth provides tax-free retirement income. Having both types by age 18 is a massive head start.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2 id="tax-comparison">Tax Treatment: Traditional vs Roth</h2>

      <p>
        This is where many people get confused. A Trump Account is <strong>not</strong> a Roth account.
        At 18, it converts to a <strong>traditional IRA</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trump Account (Traditional IRA at 18):</strong> Pay taxes when you withdraw. If your child withdraws $50,000 at age 25, they pay ordinary income tax on the full amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> Pay no taxes when you withdraw in retirement. Contributions can be withdrawn anytime tax-free. Earnings are tax-free after age 59½.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="strategy">Recommended Strategy by Age</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Birth to teen years:</strong> Trump Account only (no earned income = can't use Roth)</li>
        <li><strong>Teen with first job:</strong> Trump Account + Roth IRA (fund both)</li>
        <li><strong>Age 18+:</strong> Consider converting Trump Account traditional IRA to Roth IRA (pay taxes now, grow tax-free)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is a Trump Account like a Roth IRA?</h3>
      <p>
        No. A Trump Account converts to a <strong>traditional</strong> IRA at 18, not a Roth.
        Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I convert the Trump Account to a Roth IRA later?</h3>
      <p>
        At 18, the Trump Account becomes a traditional IRA. Your child could then do a Roth conversion
        (pay taxes on the balance now, then grow tax-free). This is a common strategy if they're in a low tax bracket at 18.
      </p>

      <h3>Which should I open first?</h3>
      <p>
        For babies and young children: Trump Account first (claim the $1,000 deposit, no earned income needed).
        For teens with jobs: both.
