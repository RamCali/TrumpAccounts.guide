      <p>
        "Baby bonds" is a term for government-funded savings accounts given to children at birth. Several versions have been proposed over the years. Trump Accounts are sometimes called "baby bonds" in the media, but they're a distinct policy. Here's how they compare.

      <h2 id="key-policy-differences">Key Policy Differences</h2>

      <h3>Universal vs Income-Targeted</h3>
      <p>
        Trump Accounts give every qualifying child the same $1,000. A billionaire's baby gets the same deposit as a minimum-wage worker's baby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baby bonds proposals (like Senator Cory Booker's ASPIRE Act or the American Opportunity Accounts Act) typically scaled deposits based on family income — giving significantly more money to children from lower-income households.
      </p>

      <h3>One-Time vs Annual</h3>
      <p>
        Trump Accounts provide a single $1,000 deposit. Families can then contribute up to $5,000/year on their own. Baby bonds proposals often included annual government contributions of $500–$2,000, funded entirely by the government.
      </p>

      <h3>Family Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Trump Accounts are designed for family and employer participation — you can add money and your employer can match. Most baby bonds proposals didn't allow private contributions, keeping the accounts purely government-funded.
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="info" title="State-level baby bonds programs">
        <p>While baby bonds never passed at the federal level, some states have implemented their own versions. Connecticut's CT Baby Bonds program (2021) provides $3,200 to children born on Medicaid. Washington, D.C. has a similar program. These state programs operate independently of Trump Accounts.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2 id="dell-bridge">The Dell Foundation: Bridging the Gap</h2>

      <p>
        Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion — $250 per child under 10 in ZIP codes with median income below $150,000. While this doesn't fully replicate income-targeted baby bonds proposals, it does add a progressive element to Trump Accounts, giving more support to children in lower-income communities.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Are Trump Accounts "baby bonds"?</h3>
      <p>
        The media sometimes uses the term, but Trump Accounts are a distinct policy. True baby bonds proposals (ASPIRE Act, American Opportunity Accounts Act) had income-targeted deposits and government-funded annual contributions. Trump Accounts have a flat $1,000 deposit and rely on family/employer contributions.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I still get baby bonds from my state?</h3>
      <p>
        It depends on your state. Connecticut, Washington D.C., and a few other jurisdictions have their own baby bonds programs. These are separate from and in addition to federal Trump Accounts.
      </p>

      <h3>Which policy gives more to poor families?</h3>
      <p>
        Baby bonds proposals gave significantly more to lower-income families. The ASPIRE Act, for example, would have provided up to $2,000 per year for the lowest-income children. Trump Accounts give the same $1,000 to everyone, though the Dell pledge adds $250 in lower-income ZIP codes.
