UTMA/UGMA accounts are custodial accounts where the child gains control at the age of majority (18-21 depending on state), with no IRA conversion and no federal deposit.' },
    { question: 'Which is better for a newborn?', answer: 'Trump Accounts are generally better for newborns because of the $1,000 federal deposit, employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and 18-year investment horizon. UTMA/UGMA accounts offer more investment flexibility but no free money or employer match.' },
    { question: 'Can I have both a Trump Account and a UTMA?', answer: 'Yes. They are completely separate account types with no interaction. You can fund both simultaneously.' },

      <p>
        UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) and UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act) custodial accounts have been the go-to way to save for kids for decades. But Trump Accounts offer some significant advantages — especially for families with newborns.

      <h2 id="tax-difference">The Tax Difference: Deferred vs Kiddie Tax</h2>

      <p>
        This is the biggest practical difference for most families.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Trump Account:</strong> Growth is completely tax-deferred. You pay zero tax on dividends and capital gains while the account grows. Taxes only apply when your child withdraws money (as ordinary income).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>UTMA/UGMA:</strong> Subject to the "kiddie tax." The first $1,300 of unearned income (dividends, interest, capital gains) is tax-free. The next $1,300 is taxed at the child's rate. Anything above $2,600 is taxed at the parent's marginal rate — which can be as high as 37%.
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Why tax deferral matters over 18 years">
        <p>With a UTMA, you're paying taxes on dividends and realized gains every year. With a Trump Account, all that money stays invested and compounds. Over 18 years, the difference can be thousands of dollars in additional growth — especially for families in higher tax brackets.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2 id="fafsa">FAFSA Impact</h2>

      <p>
        UTMA/UGMA accounts are counted as <strong>student assets</strong> on the FAFSA, which reduces financial aid eligibility by up to 20% of the account value per year. This is one of the biggest downsides of custodial accounts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trump Accounts convert to a traditional IRA at 18. While the IRS hasn't issued specific FAFSA guidance for Trump Accounts yet, traditional IRAs are generally <strong>not counted as assets</strong> on the FAFSA — only withdrawals count as income. This could be a significant advantage.

      <h2 id="when-trump-account">When to Choose a Trump Account</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Newborn born 2025–2028</strong> — claim the free $1,000</li>
        <li><strong>Employer offers matching</strong> — up to $2,500/year tax-free</li>
        <li><strong>Want tax-deferred growth</strong> — avoid kiddie tax complexity</li>
        <li><strong>Planning for college</strong> — likely better FAFSA treatment than UTMA</li>
        <li><strong>Want forced long-term savings</strong> — money is locked until 18</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="when-utma">When to Choose a UTMA/UGMA</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Want investment flexibility</strong> — individual stocks, bonds, real estate</li>
        <li><strong>May need access before 18</strong> — custodian can withdraw for child's benefit</li>
        <li><strong>Already maxing Trump Account</strong> — UTMA has no annual limit</li>
        <li><strong>Want to save more than $5,000/year</strong> — no contribution cap</li>
        <li><strong>Teaching kids about investing</strong> — buy individual stocks they can follow</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is a Trump Account the same as a UTMA?</h3>
      <p>
        No. A Trump Account is a federal program under IRC §530A that converts to a traditional IRA at 18.
        A UTMA is a state-law custodial account where the child receives the assets outright at the age of majority.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I have both?</h3>
      <p>Yes. They are completely separate account types. You can fund both simultaneously.</p>

      <h3>Which is better for college savings?</h3>
      <p>
        Neither is ideal for college specifically — a 529 plan offers tax-free withdrawals for education.
        But between these two, the Trump Account likely has a better FAFSA impact since it converts to an IRA.
