    question: 'What are the only exceptions to the no-withdrawal rule?',
    answer: 'There are exactly three exceptions: 1) Rolling over to another Trump Account (such as changing custodians), 2) Returning excess contributions that exceeded the $5,000 annual limit, and 3) Distribution upon the death of the beneficiary child.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I withdraw if my child needs the money for medical bills?',
    answer: 'No. Medical emergencies do not qualify as an exception. Before age 18, no withdrawals are permitted regardless of the reason. The account is designed for long-term growth only.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from a 529 plan or UTMA account?',
    answer: 'A 529 allows withdrawals with a 10% penalty plus taxes on non-qualified expenses. A UTMA gives the parent full control to withdraw for the child\'s benefit. Trump Accounts are the most restrictive — no withdrawals at all before 18.',

    <p>
      This is one of the most common questions parents ask: <strong>"Can I take money out of my child's Trump Account before they turn 18?"</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. And there are almost no exceptions. Here is exactly what the rules say and why.
    </p>

    <h2>The Core Rule: No Withdrawals Before 18</h2>
    <p>
      Under IRC Section 530A, Trump Accounts have a <strong>"growth phase"</strong> that runs from the time the account is opened until the child turns {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}. During this phase, the money must stay invested.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not like a savings account where you can pull money out whenever you want. It is not like a 529 where you can withdraw with a penalty. The money is <strong>locked in</strong>.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="No emergency access">
      <p>
        There is no hardship exception for Trump Accounts. Even if you face a medical emergency, job loss, or other financial crisis, you <strong>cannot withdraw</strong> from your child's Trump Account. Plan your emergency fund separately.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>The Three Exceptions</h2>
    <p>
      IRS Notice 2025-68 allows exactly three situations where money can leave a Trump Account before age {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Rollover to Another Trump Account</h3>
    <p>
      You can move the money from one Trump Account to another. This typically happens when you <strong>change custodians</strong> — for example, moving from one brokerage to another. The money goes directly from one Trump Account to the other. It does not pass through your hands.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Return of Excess Contributions</h3>
    <p>
      If someone contributes more than the <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual limit</strong>, the excess must be returned. This is a correction, not a withdrawal. The custodian sends back the extra money (plus any earnings on the excess) to avoid penalties.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Death of the Beneficiary</h3>
    <p>
      If the child passes away, the account funds can be distributed to the estate or a designated beneficiary. This is addressed in <a href="/blog/trump-account-death-of-child">our separate guide on this sensitive topic</a>.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="None of these are &quot;withdrawals&quot; in the normal sense">
      <p>
        A rollover moves money between accounts. An excess return corrects a mistake. A death distribution is a final event. None of these let you access the money for personal or family use.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Why Is It So Strict?</h2>
    <p>
      The no-withdrawal rule exists <strong>by design</strong>. Congress structured Trump Accounts to force long-term investing. The idea is simple: if you cannot touch the money for 18 years, it has time to grow through compounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical data backs this up. The S&P 500 has <strong>never lost money over any 18-year period</strong> in its history. By locking the money in, Trump Accounts protect families from the temptation to pull funds out during short-term market dips.

    <p>
      Trump Accounts are the <strong>most restrictive</strong> of all child investment accounts. That strictness is the trade-off for the $1,000 federal deposit and the tax-deferred growth.
    </p>

    <h2>What Happens After Age {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}?</h2>
    <p>
      Once the child turns {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}, the Trump Account converts to a <strong>traditional IRA</strong>. At that point, standard IRA withdrawal rules apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.</li>
      <li>A <strong>10% early withdrawal penalty</strong> applies before age 59 1/2 (with exceptions for first-time home purchase, education, disability, and more).</li>
      <li>The child has full control and can withdraw whenever they choose.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For the full breakdown of <a href="/blog/trump-account-penalties">penalties and exceptions after 18</a>, see our detailed guide. And for a deeper look at how withdrawals and use work, visit our <a href="/faq/withdrawals-and-use">withdrawals FAQ</a>.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Plan around the restriction">
      <p>
        Because Trump Account money is locked until {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}, do not use it as your only savings strategy for your child. Consider a 529 for education expenses you might need before 18, and keep a separate emergency fund for your family.
