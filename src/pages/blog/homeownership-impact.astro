    question: 'Can Trump Account money be used for a down payment?',
    answer: `Yes. At age ${limits.iraConversionAge}, the Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA. The first-time homebuyer exception allows up to $10,000 in penalty-free withdrawals. The withdrawal is still taxed as ordinary income.`,

    question: 'How much can I withdraw penalty-free for a first home?',
    answer: 'The IRA first-time homebuyer exception allows up to $10,000 in penalty-free withdrawals. You avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty, but you still owe ordinary income tax on the amount.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I need more than $10,000 for a down payment?',
    answer: 'You can withdraw more than $10,000, but amounts above $10,000 will face both ordinary income tax AND the 10% early withdrawal penalty (if you are under 59.5). Combining Trump Account funds with personal savings is a smart strategy.',

  {
    question: 'Could Trump Accounts increase the national homeownership rate?',
    answer: 'Potentially. If millions of young adults reach 18 with $50,000+ in their IRA, more of them could afford down payments in their early 20s. The national homeownership rate is about 65%. Even a small increase would represent hundreds of thousands of new homeowners.',

    question: 'What is the biggest barrier to homeownership for young adults?',
    answer: 'The down payment. According to the National Association of Realtors, saving for a down payment is the #1 obstacle for first-time buyers. A Trump Account that grows for 18 years could help overcome this barrier.',

    <p>
      For most young Americans, buying a first home feels impossible. The median home price is over <strong>$400,000</strong>. A 10% down payment is $40,000. Where does that money come from when you are 22 and just starting out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Trump Accounts could change that math. Here is how.
    </p>

    <h2>The Down Payment Problem</h2>
    <p>
      According to the National Association of Realtors, the <strong>down payment is the #1 obstacle</strong> for first-time homebuyers. Many young adults have student loans, entry-level salaries, and little savings. Without help from family, saving $20,000-$40,000 for a down payment can take <strong>years</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The national homeownership rate sits at about <strong>65%</strong>. For adults under 35, it is significantly lower — around <strong>39%</strong>. The gap between wanting a home and being able to afford one is wider than ever.
    </p>

    <h2>How a Trump Account Changes the Equation</h2>
    <p>
      A child born in {limits.pilotDepositStartYear} receives the <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong>. If the family contributes even modest amounts, the account could be worth <strong>five or six figures</strong> by age 18:

    <p>
      At 18, the Trump Account <strong>converts to a traditional IRA</strong>. The young adult now has a real financial asset they can use toward homeownership.
    </p>

    <h2>The First-Time Homebuyer Exception</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional IRAs normally charge a <strong>10% early withdrawal penalty</strong> if you take money out before age 59 and a half. But there is an important exception: first-time homebuyers can withdraw up to <strong>$10,000 penalty-free</strong>.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Penalty-free does not mean tax-free">
      <p>
        The $10,000 first-time homebuyer exception waives the 10% early withdrawal penalty. You still owe <strong>ordinary income tax</strong> on the withdrawal. If you are in the 12% tax bracket, $10,000 withdrawn means roughly $1,200 in federal tax.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <p>
      For a young adult with an $80,000 Trump Account (now IRA), the path to homeownership could look like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Withdraw <strong>$10,000 penalty-free</strong> using the first-time homebuyer exception</li>
      <li>Save an additional <strong>$10,000-$20,000</strong> from working after age 18</li>
      <li>Total down payment fund: <strong>$20,000-$30,000</strong> by the early 20s</li>
      <li>That is enough for a 5-10% down payment on a home in many markets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The remaining balance stays invested in the IRA, continuing to grow for retirement or other future needs.
    </p>

    <h2>A Realistic Example</h2>
    <p>
      Meet a hypothetical 22-year-old who was born in 2025. Their parents contributed <strong>$150/month</strong> to their Trump Account from birth. At age 18, the account is worth about <strong>$68,000</strong> (at 8% returns). By 22, it has grown to roughly <strong>$92,000</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      They withdraw <strong>$10,000</strong> using the homebuyer exception and combine it with <strong>$15,000</strong> they saved from working. That gives them a <strong>$25,000 down payment</strong> — enough for a 5% down payment on a $500,000 home, or 10% on a $250,000 home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining <strong>$82,000</strong> stays in the IRA, compounding toward retirement. This young adult is a homeowner at 22 with a six-figure retirement account. That is a very different starting point than most young adults have today.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Keep the rest invested">
      <p>
        Withdrawing the entire Trump Account for a home purchase means losing decades of future compound growth. Using the $10,000 exception and supplementing with savings preserves most of the account for long-term growth.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Could This Move the Homeownership Rate?</h2>
    <p>
      If <strong>3.6 million children per year</strong> reach 18 with meaningful financial assets, a significant number of them could buy homes sooner than previous generations. Even if Trump Accounts help <strong>5-10%</strong> of a birth cohort buy a home earlier, that represents <strong>180,000-360,000 additional young homeowners</strong> per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Homeownership has ripple effects beyond the individual:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Community stability</strong> — Homeowners tend to stay longer and invest in their neighborhoods</li>
      <li><strong>Wealth building</strong> — Home equity is the largest source of wealth for most American families</li>
      <li><strong>Economic activity</strong> — Home purchases drive spending on furniture, renovations, and services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations to Consider</h2>
    <p>
      Trump Accounts are not a complete solution to the housing affordability crisis. Several factors matter:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Housing supply</strong> — If demand increases but supply does not, prices rise and the advantage shrinks</li>
      <li><strong>The $10,000 cap</strong> — In expensive markets, $10,000 penalty-free is not enough for a meaningful down payment on its own</li>
      <li><strong>Tax cost</strong> — Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, reducing the effective amount available</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunity cost</strong> — Money withdrawn for a home stops compounding for retirement</li>
    </ul>
