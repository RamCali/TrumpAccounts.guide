    question: 'How much can the $1,000 deposit grow to without any extra contributions?',
    answer: 'At the S&P 500 historical average of about 10% per year, $1,000 grows to roughly $5,560 over 18 years. At a more conservative 7% (inflation-adjusted), it reaches about $3,380.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I contribute $100 per month on top of the deposit?',
    answer: `With the $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit plus $100/month at 10% average returns, the account could reach roughly $56,000 by age 18. At 8%, it would be about $52,000.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How much wealth could one generation of Trump Account children create?',
    answer: 'With 3.6 million births per year and an average account value of $50,000 at age 18, a single birth cohort could hold $180 billion in total wealth. That number grows significantly if families contribute more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this the first investment account for most American families?',
    answer: 'For many families, yes. About 40% of American adults do not own any stocks or stock funds. A Trump Account may be the first time millions of families have money invested in the market.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can the money keep growing after age 18?',
    answer: 'Yes. At 18, the Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA. If the child leaves the money invested, it keeps compounding. The $1,000 deposit alone, left untouched until age 65, could reach over $490,000 at 10% returns.',

    <p>
      The real power of Trump Accounts is not the $1,000 deposit. It is <strong>compound growth over 18 years</strong>. Even small amounts, invested consistently in the stock market, can grow into serious money. Let's walk through the math.
    </p>

    <h2>The Math of Compounding</h2>
    <p>
      Compounding means your returns earn their own returns. The longer money stays invested, the faster it grows. Over 18 years in S&P 500 index funds, even modest amounts can snowball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is what different contribution levels look like at a <strong>10% average annual return</strong> (the S&P 500's historical nominal average):

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="About 10% returns">
      <p>
        The S&P 500 has historically averaged about 10% per year before inflation (roughly 7% after inflation). Actual returns will vary year to year. Some 18-year periods have delivered more, some less. These projections assume a consistent average for illustration.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>The Deposit-Only Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      Not every family can contribute extra — and that is okay. The <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong> works on its own. At 10% average returns, it grows to about <strong>$5,560</strong> by age 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      That may sound modest. But consider two things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It cost the family <strong>nothing</strong>.</li>
      <li>At 18, it converts to a traditional IRA and keeps compounding. Left untouched until age 65, that $5,560 could grow to over <strong>$490,000</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The deposit is a seed. Time is the sunlight.
    </p>

    <h2>The Power of $100 Per Month</h2>
    <p>
      One hundred dollars per month is about <strong>$3.33 per day</strong>. Many families spend more than that on streaming subscriptions. Yet $100/month, starting at birth with the $1,000 deposit, could grow to about <strong>$56,000 by age 18</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is $56,000 from contributing $22,600 over 18 years. The other $33,400? <strong>Pure compound growth</strong>. The market did the heavy lifting.
    </p>

    <h2>The Sweet Spot: $250 Per Month</h2>
    <p>
      Contributing <strong>$250/month</strong> ($3,000/year, well within the <a href="/blog/contribution-limits-explained">${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual limit</a>) could build a six-figure account. At 10% returns, the projection reaches about <strong>$108,000</strong> by age 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, <a href="/blog/can-parents-grandparents-contribute">anyone can contribute</a> — grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends. Splitting $250 across multiple family members makes this target more achievable.
    </p>

    <h2>Maxing Out: $416 Per Month</h2>
    <p>
      Families who can afford the full <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong> (about $416/month) could see roughly <strong>$175,000</strong> at 10% returns. That is a transformative amount of money for an 18-year-old — enough to fund college, start a business, or make a serious down payment on a home.

    <h2>Generational Wealth at Scale</h2>
    <p>
      The individual numbers are compelling. The generational numbers are staggering. Consider what happens across an entire birth cohort:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3.6 million children</strong> born per year</li>
      <li>If the average account reaches <strong>$50,000</strong> by age 18 (a moderate assumption)</li>
      <li>That is <strong>$180 billion in new wealth</strong> per birth cohort</li>
      <li>Over four pilot cohorts: potentially <strong>$720 billion</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No single government program has ever created this much <strong>broadly distributed, individually owned wealth</strong> for young adults.
    </p>

    <h2>First-Generation Wealth Effect</h2>
    <p>
      About <strong>40% of American adults</strong> do not own any stocks or stock funds. For many families, a Trump Account will be their <strong>first-ever investment account</strong>. This matters because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Families who own investments tend to build more wealth over time</li>
      <li>Children who grow up seeing an investment account understand compounding</li>
      <li>Having assets changes how families approach financial decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Economists call this the <strong>"first-generation wealth effect"</strong> — the idea that owning even a small amount of wealth changes behavior and creates a foundation for more.
    </p>

    <h2>What Happens After 18</h2>
    <p>
      At age {limits.iraConversionAge}, the Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA. The young adult can keep it invested, withdraw funds (subject to <a href="/blog/gains-taxation-explained">income tax and potential penalties</a>), or convert it to a <a href="/blog/trump-account-roth-conversion-strategy">Roth IRA</a>. The wealth creation does not stop at 18 — it can continue for decades.
