    question: 'Can grandparents contribute to a grandchild\'s Trump Account?',
    answer: `Yes. Anyone can contribute to a child's Trump Account — parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, or anyone else. The combined total from all contributors cannot exceed $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} per year.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Does each contributor get their own $5,000 limit?',
    answer: `No. The $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual limit is a total cap on the account, not per contributor. If a parent contributes $3,000 and a grandparent contributes $2,000, the limit is reached.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do Trump Account contributions count as gifts for tax purposes?',
    answer: 'Contributions by someone other than the parent may be considered gifts under federal tax law. However, the annual gift tax exclusion is $18,000 per recipient (2025), so Trump Account contributions of up to $5,000 would fall well below this threshold.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can an employer contribution and a grandparent contribution happen in the same year?',
    answer: `Yes. Employer contributions (up to $${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}) and family contributions can both go into the same account. But the combined total from all sources cannot exceed $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year.`,
  },

    <p>
      One of the best features of Trump Accounts is that <strong>there are no restrictions on who can contribute</strong>. Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, family friends — anyone who wants to invest in a child's future can chip in.
    </p>

    <h2>The $5,000 Limit Is Per Account, Not Per Person</h2>
    <p>
      This is the most important rule to understand. The <strong><a href="/blog/contribution-limits-explained">${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual contribution limit</a></strong> applies to the total amount going into the account from all sources combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not matter whether one person contributes $5,000 or five people each contribute $1,000. Once the account hits $5,000 for the year, no more contributions are allowed until the next year.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="Watch the total carefully">
      <p>
        If multiple family members are contributing, coordinate to avoid going over the <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} limit</strong>. Excess contributions may trigger penalties. See our <a href="/blog/contribution-limits-explained">contribution limits breakdown</a> for details on what happens if you over-contribute.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>How Grandparent Contributions Work</h2>
    <p>
      Grandparents can contribute directly to a grandchild's Trump Account. There is no special process. They send money to the account, and it counts toward the <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual cap</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes Trump Accounts an excellent option for grandparents who want to give a meaningful financial gift. Instead of toys or clothes, a $1,000 contribution at birth could grow to <strong>$4,000+</strong> by age 18 — without the grandparent doing anything else.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Birthday and holiday gifts">
      <p>
        Consider asking family members to contribute to the Trump Account instead of buying gifts. A $50 birthday contribution each year from four grandparents adds up to $200/year — nearly $4,000 in contributions over 18 years before growth.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Employer Contributions Count Too</h2>
    <p>
      Employers can contribute up to <strong><a href="/blog/employer-match-trump-account">${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} per year</a></strong> per employee under IRC Section 128. These contributions are tax-free to the employee.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, employer contributions <strong>count toward the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual cap</strong>. If an employer contributes $2,500, the family can only add another $2,500 from all other sources combined.
    </p>

    <h2>Gift Tax Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      When someone other than the parent contributes to a child's Trump Account, the IRS may consider it a gift. The good news: the <strong>annual gift tax exclusion is $18,000 per recipient</strong> (as of 2025).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Trump Account contributions max out at ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year, they fall well below the gift tax threshold. Grandparents and other family members generally <strong>will not owe gift tax</strong> and do not need to file gift tax returns for these contributions.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Multiple grandchildren?">
      <p>
        The $18,000 gift tax exclusion applies per recipient. Grandparents with three grandchildren could contribute up to $5,000 to each child's Trump Account ($15,000 total) without any gift tax concerns.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Coordinating Contributions Across Family Members</h2>
    <p>
      With multiple people contributing, communication is key. Here are some practical tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Set a plan at the start of the year.</strong> Decide who contributes how much so you do not accidentally exceed $5,000.</li>
      <li><strong>Track contributions.</strong> Keep a simple spreadsheet or shared note that everyone updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Account for employer contributions first.</strong> If a parent's employer contributes $2,500, the family only has $2,500 left to split.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider automatic monthly contributions.</strong> Parents set up $100/month, and grandparents contribute lump sums for birthdays or holidays.</li>
    </ul>
