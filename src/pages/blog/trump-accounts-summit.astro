The summit generated massive media attention and pushed enrollment past <strong>1 million sign-ups</strong>. Here is everything that happened.
    </p>

    <h2>What Happened at the Summit</h2>

      The Trump Accounts Summit was designed to <strong>advance national participation</strong> in the Trump Accounts initiative. The event featured speeches from top government officials, corporate commitments, and a surprise celebrity appearance that dominated news coverage for days.

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Summit location: Mellon Auditorium">
      <p>
        The event was held at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, a historic Treasury Department building in Washington, D.C. The auditorium is named after Andrew Mellon, Treasury Secretary from 1921 to 1932, who was known for tax reform policies. A fitting venue for a program aimed at giving every child an investment account.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Nicki Minaj's Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest headline from the summit was <strong>Nicki Minaj's appearance</strong> as the featured guest. The rapper spoke alongside President Trump, praising the program's potential benefits for children and working parents. She expressed enthusiasm about the initiative on social media, helping drive massive online engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treasury Secretary Bessent later said the segment featuring Trump and Minaj achieved <strong>"a billion hits"</strong> on the internet.

    <h2>Philanthropic Donors</h2>
    <p>
      Five individuals and families were recognized as philanthropic donors to the Trump Accounts initiative:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Michael & Susan Dell</strong> — the largest known private commitment at <a href="/blog/dell-pledge-explained">$6.25 billion</a>, providing $250 per child under 10 in qualifying ZIP codes.</li>
      <li><strong>Ray & Barbara Dalio</strong> — Bridgewater Associates founder and philanthropist.</li>
      <li><strong>Brad Gerstner</strong> — Altimeter Capital founder and vocal children's investment advocate.</li>
      <li><strong>Harold Hamm</strong> — Continental Resources founder.</li>
      <li><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong> — rapper and featured guest at the summit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Enrollment Surge: 1 Million Sign-Ups</h2>
    <p>
      The summit's biggest measurable impact was on <strong>enrollment numbers</strong>. The day after the event, Treasury Secretary Bessent announced at a Cabinet meeting that Trump Account registrations had reached approximately <strong>1 million</strong>, roughly <strong>doubling</strong> in the days following the summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officials credited the viral media coverage — particularly the Trump-Minaj segment, which Bessent said achieved "a billion hits" online — for driving the surge. The administration estimates as many as <strong>25 million families</strong> nationwide could qualify for the program.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Have you signed up yet?">
      <p>
        If the summit inspired you to open a Trump Account, here is how to get started: file <strong>{limits.form}</strong> with your {limits.pilotDepositStartYear} tax return (due April 15, 2026). For the complete walkthrough, see <a href="/blog/how-to-open-step-by-step">how to open a Trump Account</a>.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>What Was Announced: Key Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visa</strong> announced a future option for cardholders to direct credit card rewards into Trump Accounts. <a href="/blog/visa-trump-accounts">Full details here</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Official launch date confirmed</strong>: Trump Accounts officially launch on <strong>July 5, 2026</strong> through the {limits.portal} portal.</li>
      <li><strong>Corporate employer matching</strong>: Several companies signaled they would offer Trump Account contributions as an employee benefit under IRC Section 128.</li>
      <li><strong>Brokerages ready</strong>: Schwab, Robinhood, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and SoFi all committed to supporting the program as potential trustees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What This Means for Families</h2>
    <p>
      The summit was a promotional event — it did not change any rules or contribution limits. The core program remains the same:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} pilot deposit</strong> for children born {limits.pilotDepositStartYear}–{limits.pilotDepositEndYear}</li>
      <li><strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong> contribution limit from all sources</li>
      <li><strong>${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong> employer contribution (tax-free under IRC §128)</li>
      <li><strong>Must file {limits.form}</strong> to opt in — it is not automatic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What the summit <strong>did</strong> change is the level of corporate support. With 27 companies committing to the program, families are likely to see more employer-sponsored Trump Account benefits, more fund choices, and more ways to contribute (like Visa's credit card rewards feature).
