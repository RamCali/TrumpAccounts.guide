    <p>
      No parent wants to think about this. But knowing how a Trump Account is handled in this situation can provide a small measure of peace of mind. IRS Notice 2025-68 addresses this topic directly, and we want to make sure you have clear, factual information.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Rules Work</h2>
    <p>
      The death of the beneficiary child is one of only three exceptions that allow funds to leave a Trump Account before age {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}. The other two are rollovers and return of excess contributions. You can read about all three in our <a href="/blog/early-withdrawal-before-18">early withdrawal guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a child who holds a Trump Account passes away, the account funds <strong>can be distributed</strong>. The money does not disappear or revert to the government. It goes to the people the child's family has designated.
    </p>

    <h2>Where the Funds Go</h2>
    <p>
      The distribution depends on whether a beneficiary has been named on the account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If a beneficiary is designated:</strong> The funds go directly to that person. This avoids probate and is typically the fastest and simplest path.</li>
      <li><strong>If no beneficiary is designated:</strong> The funds go to the child's estate. This may require probate proceedings, which can take time and involve legal costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Designate a beneficiary when you open the account">
      <p>
        When you file <a href="/blog/how-to-open-step-by-step">IRS Form 4547</a> or open the account through trumpaccounts.gov, take the time to name a beneficiary. This ensures the funds are handled according to your family's wishes and avoids unnecessary legal complexity during an already difficult time.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Tax Treatment</h2>
    <p>
      Death distributions from a Trump Account are handled as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No 10% early withdrawal penalty.</strong> The penalty that normally applies to IRA withdrawals before age 59 1/2 does not apply to distributions caused by death. This is true regardless of the child's age.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxed as ordinary income.</strong> The distributed funds are generally included as ordinary income on the applicable tax return. Depending on the circumstances, this may be the child's final tax return or the beneficiary's return.</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Consult a tax professional">
      <p>
        The tax treatment of death distributions can vary based on your specific situation — the size of the account, the beneficiary's tax bracket, and state tax laws all play a role. A qualified tax professional can help navigate the details.

    <h2>Practical Steps for Parents</h2>
    <p>
      While no one expects to need this information, here are steps you can take now to make sure the account is handled properly if the worst were to happen:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name a beneficiary.</strong> Do this when you open the account. You can usually update it later if your wishes change.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep the designation current.</strong> Review the beneficiary designation if family circumstances change — for example, after a divorce, remarriage, or the birth of other children.</li>
      <li><strong>Inform your family.</strong> Make sure your spouse, partner, or other family members know the account exists and who the designated beneficiary is.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep account documents accessible.</strong> Store Trump Account paperwork with other important financial documents so that a family member or executor can find it if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Help</h2>
    <p>
      If you are dealing with this situation now, we are sorry for your loss. Here are resources that may help:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact the account custodian.</strong> The brokerage or institution holding the Trump Account can walk you through the distribution process.</li>
      <li><strong>Work with a tax professional.</strong> They can help with the tax return and ensure distributions are reported correctly.</li>
      <li><strong>Consult an estate attorney.</strong> If no beneficiary was designated and probate is needed, an attorney can guide you through the process.</li>
    </ul>
