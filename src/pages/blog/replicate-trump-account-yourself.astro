    question: 'Can I open both a Trump Account and a custodial account for my child?',
    answer: 'Yes. If your child qualifies for a Trump Account, you can also open a custodial UTMA/UGMA account. They are separate accounts with separate rules. Many families use both.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is a custodial account as good as a Trump Account?',
    answer: 'A custodial account does not come with the $1,000 government deposit, and the tax treatment is different (kiddie tax rules apply). But it offers more flexibility — you can invest in anything, withdraw at any time, and there is no age-18 lock-in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the kiddie tax?',
    answer: 'The kiddie tax means that unearned income (like investment gains) above a certain threshold in a child\'s custodial account is taxed at the parent\'s marginal tax rate. For 2025, the first $1,300 is tax-free, the next $1,300 is taxed at the child\'s rate, and anything above that is taxed at the parent\'s rate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can my child born in 2020 get the $1,000 federal deposit?',
    answer: 'No. The $1,000 pilot deposit is only for children born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028. Children born before 2025 can still open a Trump Account and receive family contributions, but there is no government deposit.',

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Not every child qualifies for the <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong>. That deposit is only for children born between {limits.pilotDepositStartYear} and {limits.pilotDepositEndYear}. If your child was born before 2025, is already 18, or does not have U.S. citizenship, they miss the deposit.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the <em>strategy</em> behind a Trump Account is not new. You can replicate it yourself using a custodial brokerage account and the same index funds. Here is how.
    </p>

    <h2>Option 1: Open a Trump Account Without the Deposit</h2>

    <p>
      This is the first thing to check. Children born <strong>before 2025 but still under 18</strong> can open a Trump Account. They will not receive the ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} government deposit, but they can still receive up to <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong> in family contributions and up to <strong>${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}</strong> from an employer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The account works the same way: money goes into eligible S&P 500 index funds, grows tax-deferred, and converts to a traditional IRA at age 18. The only difference is the missing deposit.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Check eligibility first">
      If your child is a U.S. citizen, has an SSN, and is under 18, they can open a Trump Account even without the $1,000 deposit. File {limits.form} and start contributing. See our <a href="/blog/how-to-open-step-by-step" class="text-mint-300 hover:text-mint-200">step-by-step guide</a>.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Option 2: Open a Custodial Brokerage Account</h2>

    <p>
      If your child is over 18 or does not qualify for a Trump Account, a <strong>custodial brokerage account</strong> is the next best thing. These come in two types:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act)</strong> &mdash; available in all 50 states, can hold any type of asset.</li>
      <li><strong>UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act)</strong> &mdash; more limited in what it can hold, but available everywhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can open a UTMA/UGMA at any major brokerage: Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, or others. The process takes about 15 minutes online.
    </p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step: Replicate the Strategy</h2>

    <p>
      Here is how to mirror the Trump Account approach:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1: Open a custodial account.</strong> Choose a brokerage with low fees. Fidelity and Schwab both offer custodial accounts with no account minimums and no maintenance fees.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2: Buy the same index funds.</strong> Invest in S&P 500 index funds or ETFs. The same ones eligible for Trump Accounts work perfectly:

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3: Contribute regularly.</strong> Set up automatic monthly contributions. Aim for $200-$417/month to mirror the Trump Account contribution pace.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 4: Leave it alone.</strong> Do not sell during downturns. The whole point is long-term compounding. A Trump Account forces this by locking funds until 18. With a custodial account, you have to enforce this discipline yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Differences You Need to Know</h2>

    <p>
      A custodial account is not a perfect clone of a Trump Account. Here are the important differences:

    </div>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="The kiddie tax matters">
      In a custodial account, your child's investment gains above a certain threshold are taxed at the parent's tax rate. This can be a significant difference compared to the Trump Account's tax-deferred growth. For 2025, the threshold is $2,600 in unearned income.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>The Biggest Advantage: Flexibility</h2>

    <p>
      A custodial account has one major advantage over a Trump Account: <strong>flexibility</strong>. You can invest in anything, not just S&P 500 index funds. You can withdraw for the child's benefit at any time. And there is no annual contribution cap (though gift tax rules apply above $18,000/year per giver).
    </p>

    <p>
      That flexibility is also the biggest risk. Without the forced lock-in, it is tempting to withdraw during emergencies or sell during market downturns. The Trump Account's restrictions protect the investment. A custodial account requires more discipline.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>

    <p>
      If your child qualifies for a Trump Account, <strong>open one first</strong>. The tax-deferred growth and potential government deposit make it the better vehicle for long-term wealth building.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your child does not qualify &mdash; or if you want to save beyond the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual cap &mdash; a custodial brokerage account is an excellent supplement. Buy the same low-cost S&P 500 index funds, contribute regularly, and resist the urge to touch it.
