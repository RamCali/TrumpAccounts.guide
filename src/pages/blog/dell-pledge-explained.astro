    <p>
      When Trump Accounts were signed into law, one of the biggest headlines was not about the government program itself. It was about a private pledge: <strong>Michael and Susan Dell committed $6.25 billion</strong> to help fund accounts for children in lower-income communities. Here is exactly how it works.
    </p>

    <h2>Dell and Trump Accounts: How the Partnership Works</h2>
    <p>
      Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies, and his wife Susan announced a pledge of <strong>$6.25 billion</strong> through the Dell Foundation. The money goes directly into Trump Accounts for qualifying children. It is the <strong>largest known private commitment</strong> tied to the program, and it specifically targets kids in lower-income communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key details:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Amount per child</strong>: ${limits.dellPledge.perChildAmount}</li>
      <li><strong>Eligible age</strong>: Children under age {limits.dellPledge.eligibleAge}</li>
      <li><strong>Income threshold</strong>: Child must live in a ZIP code where median household income is below $${limits.dellPledge.zipCodeMedianIncomeThreshold.toLocaleString()}</li>
      <li><strong>Source</strong>: Entirely private — Dell Foundation funds, not taxpayer money</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Private money, not public">
      <p>
        The Dell pledge is funded entirely by the Dell Foundation. It is not part of the federal budget and does not add to the national debt. When calculating the <a href="/blog/cost-to-taxpayers">cost to taxpayers</a>, the Dell pledge should not be included.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Who Qualifies?</h2>
    <p>
      The Dell pledge targets children in <strong>lower-income communities</strong> using ZIP code-level income data. To qualify, a child must:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be <strong>under age {limits.dellPledge.eligibleAge}</strong></li>
      <li>Live in a ZIP code where the <strong>median household income is below $${limits.dellPledge.zipCodeMedianIncomeThreshold.toLocaleString()}</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The $${limits.dellPledge.zipCodeMedianIncomeThreshold.toLocaleString()} threshold is important. The median household income in the United States is roughly $75,000. A $${limits.dellPledge.zipCodeMedianIncomeThreshold.toLocaleString()} ZIP code threshold covers the <strong>vast majority of American ZIP codes</strong>. Only the wealthiest neighborhoods are excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means most American children — not just those in poverty — qualify for the Dell contribution.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Money Works</h2>
    <p>
      The $${limits.dellPledge.perChildAmount} Dell pledge is deposited directly into the child's Trump Account, alongside the <strong>$${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong> (for children born {limits.pilotDepositStartYear}-{limits.pilotDepositEndYear}). For a qualifying newborn:

    </div>

    <p>
      That $1,250 starting balance is <strong>25% more</strong> than the federal deposit alone. Over 18 years of compound growth, the difference adds up.

    <p>
      At the S&P 500's historical average of about <strong>10% per year</strong>, the Dell pledge turns $1,000 into $1,250 — and $5,560 into <strong>$6,950</strong> by age 18. That is an extra <strong>$1,390</strong> from a single $250 contribution. The power of compounding makes even small additions meaningful over time.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Add family contributions for bigger growth">
      <p>
        The Dell pledge is on top of whatever families contribute. A qualifying child who also receives $100/month in family contributions could have over <strong>$57,000</strong> by age 18 (at 10% returns).

    <h2>Why the Dell Pledge Matters for Equity</h2>
    <p>
      One of the <a href="/blog/inequality-reduction">concerns about Trump Accounts</a> is that wealthier families benefit more because they can contribute the full <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong>. Low-income families may not be able to contribute anything beyond the government deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dell pledge partially addresses this by <strong>targeting lower-income ZIP codes</strong>. Families who cannot afford extra contributions still get a $250 boost. It does not fully close the gap between a $5,560 deposit-only account and a $175,000 maxed-out account, but it moves in the right direction.
    </p>

    <h2>Scale of the Pledge</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>$6.25 billion total</strong>, the Dell pledge could reach roughly <strong>25 million children</strong> ($6.25B / $250 per child). That is a significant share of America's child population (there are about 73 million children under 18 in the U.S.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The pledge is expected to be distributed alongside the government's pilot deposits. For newborns in qualifying ZIP codes, the Dell contribution and the federal deposit arrive together — giving the account a <strong>$1,250 starting balance</strong> from day one.
