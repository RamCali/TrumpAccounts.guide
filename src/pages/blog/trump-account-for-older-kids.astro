    question: 'Can a 10-year-old open a Trump Account?',
    answer: `Yes. Any U.S. citizen child under 18 with a valid SSN can open a Trump Account. A 10-year-old gets 8 years of tax-deferred growth before the account converts to an IRA at ${limits.growthPhaseEndAge}. They will not receive the $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} pilot deposit (only for 2025-2028 births).`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it worth opening a Trump Account for a teenager?',
    answer: `Even a few years of tax-deferred growth has value. A 15-year-old gets 3 years. If you contribute $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year at 8% returns, that is roughly $17,500 by age 18 — plus it becomes a head-start IRA for retirement.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do older kids get the $1,000 government deposit?',
    answer: `No. The $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} pilot deposit is only for children born between ${limits.pilotDepositStartYear} and ${limits.pilotDepositEndYear}. Older children can still receive family contributions up to $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year and employer contributions up to $${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the oldest a child can be to open a Trump Account?',
    answer: 'The child must be under 18 at the end of the election year. A 17-year-old can open one, but they will only have about 1 year of growth before the account converts to an IRA at 18.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can older kids get the Dell pledge money?',
    answer: `Yes. The Dell pledge offers $${limits.dellPledge.perChildAmount} per child ${limits.dellPledge.eligibleAge} in ZIP codes with median income below $${limits.dellPledge.zipCodeMedianIncomeThreshold.toLocaleString()}. This is separate from the federal pilot deposit and applies to already-born children.`,

        <li>Trump Accounts are <strong class="text-white">not just for newborns</strong>. Any child under 18 qualifies.</li>

    <p>
      Most of the headlines about Trump Accounts focus on newborns and the ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} government deposit. But here is what many parents miss: <strong>any U.S. citizen child under 18 can open a Trump Account</strong>. Your 3-year-old, your 8-year-old, even your 16-year-old.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rules are simple. If your child has a valid SSN and is under 18, they are eligible. The only thing older kids miss out on is the ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} pilot deposit. Everything else — family contributions, employer match, tax-deferred growth, the IRA conversion at 18 — is identical.

      The younger the child, the more compounding time they have. Here is what ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year (about $417/month) could grow to by age 18, assuming 8% average annual returns:

    <h2>Why Open One for an Older Child?</h2>

    <h3>1. Tax-Deferred Growth</h3>

    <p>
      In a regular brokerage account, your child pays taxes on dividends and capital gains every year. In a Trump Account, growth is <strong>tax-deferred</strong>. No taxes until withdrawal after 18. Over even 5-10 years, that tax savings compounds significantly.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Head-Start IRA</h3>

    <p>
      At 18, the Trump Account becomes a <strong>traditional IRA</strong>. Most young adults do not start retirement saving until their mid-20s or 30s. Your child starts with an IRA that already has years of growth — a massive advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even better: at 18, your child can <strong>convert it to a Roth IRA</strong> while in a low tax bracket. That means decades of tax-free growth for retirement. See our <a href="/blog/trump-account-roth-conversion-strategy">Roth conversion strategy guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Employer Match</h3>

    <p>
      If your employer offers Trump Account contributions under IRC Section 128, that is up to <strong>${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year in tax-free money</strong> — regardless of your child's age. This benefit applies equally to a 2-year-old and a 15-year-old.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Dell Pledge for Under 10</h3>

    <p>
      Children {limits.dellPledge.eligibleAge} in ZIP codes with median income below ${limits.dellPledge.zipCodeMedianIncomeThreshold.toLocaleString()} may qualify for the <strong>${limits.dellPledge.perChildAmount} Dell pledge</strong>. This is separate from the federal pilot deposit and applies to already-born children.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Financial Literacy</h3>

    <p>
      Older kids can actually understand what is happening with their money. Showing a 10-year-old their S&P 500 returns teaches investing basics that will benefit them for life.
    </p>

    <h2>Is It Worth It for a Teenager?</h2>

    <p>
      Even with only a few years of growth, the answer is usually <strong>yes</strong>. Here is why:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The IRA conversion alone has value.</strong> At 18, your teenager has an IRA. Most 18-year-olds have nothing. Even $5,000-$15,000 in an IRA at 18 can grow to $100,000+ by retirement age without any additional contributions.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax-deferred growth matters even short-term.</strong> Three years of S&P 500 returns without annual capital gains taxes is better than a taxable brokerage account.</li>
      <li><strong>Employer match is free money.</strong> If available, ${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year of tax-free contributions for even 2-3 years is significant.</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="The $5,000 thought experiment">
      If your 17-year-old puts $5,000 in a Trump Account and never touches it again, at 8% average returns that $5,000 becomes roughly $105,000 by age 65. One contribution. One year. Over $100K in retirement wealth.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>How to Open an Account for an Older Child</h2>

    <p>
      The process is identical to opening one for a newborn:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Verify eligibility:</strong> U.S. citizen, valid SSN, under 18.</li>
      <li><strong>File {limits.form}</strong> with your 2025 tax return (due April 15, 2026) or through {limits.portal}.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose an eligible index fund</strong> (VOO, IVV, SPLG, VTI, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Start contributing</strong> — up to ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year from all sources.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Do NOT check the pilot deposit box. The ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit is only for 2025-2028 births. Checking it for an older child could cause a processing error.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the full walkthrough, see our <a href="/blog/how-to-open-step-by-step">step-by-step guide to opening a Trump Account</a>. To check eligibility, use our <a href="/calculators/eligibility-checker">eligibility checker</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>
      Do not skip a Trump Account just because your child is not a newborn. The ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit is a nice bonus, but it is small compared to what a family can contribute over time. Even 5 years of ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year at 8% returns creates real wealth. And the IRA conversion at 18 gives every child — newborn or teenager — a financial head start that most adults never had.
