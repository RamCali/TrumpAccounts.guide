    question: 'Does a Trump Account replace Social Security?',
    answer: 'No. Trump Accounts and Social Security are completely separate programs with different purposes. Social Security provides retirement and disability insurance funded by payroll taxes. A Trump Account is a child investment account. Your child will still pay into and receive Social Security benefits as an adult.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do payroll taxes fund Trump Accounts?',
    answer: `No. The $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} pilot deposit comes from general federal revenue, not from Social Security payroll taxes (FICA). Social Security is funded separately through the 6.2% employee and 6.2% employer payroll tax.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Will having a Trump Account reduce my child\'s Social Security benefits?',
    answer: 'No. Social Security benefits are based on work history and earnings. Having a Trump Account (or the traditional IRA it converts to at 18) does not reduce Social Security benefits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can a Trump Account provide retirement income like Social Security?',
    answer: 'Yes, in a different way. At age 18, the Trump Account becomes a traditional IRA. If your child leaves the money invested, it can grow for decades and provide retirement income. But unlike Social Security, it is not guaranteed -- it depends on market returns and contributions.',

    <h2>Two Very Different Programs</h2>
    <p>
      Some people wonder if Trump Accounts are related to Social Security or if one replaces the other.
      The short answer: <strong>they have nothing to do with each other</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social Security has been around since 1935. It is a social insurance program that provides income
      to retirees, disabled workers, and survivors. You pay into it through payroll taxes your entire
      working life, and you collect benefits when you retire (or if you become disabled).
    </p>
    <p>
      A Trump Account is brand new. Created by {limits.legalBasis} in July 2025, it is an investment
      account for children. The government deposits <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()}</strong>
      for eligible newborns, families can contribute up to
      <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong>, and the money grows in index
      funds until the child turns {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="The simple version">
      Social Security pays out when you are old. A Trump Account gives your child a financial head start
      when they are young. They solve different problems at different stages of life.

    <h2>Different Funding, Different Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Social Security is funded by <strong>payroll taxes</strong>. Every paycheck, 6.2% of your wages goes
      to Social Security (your employer pays another 6.2%). That money funds current retirees' benefits.
      There is no individual investment account with your name on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Trump Account is the opposite. It is a <strong>real account in your child's name</strong>. The
      ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit comes from general government revenue, not
      from payroll taxes. Family contributions come from after-tax income. The money is invested in actual
      index funds, and the balance belongs to your child.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Your child gets both">
      Having a Trump Account does not change anything about Social Security. When your child grows up
      and starts working, they will pay payroll taxes and earn Social Security credits just like everyone
      else. The Trump Account is an extra benefit on top of that.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Can a Trump Account Help with Retirement?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes -- but in a very different way than Social Security. At age {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}, the Trump
      Account converts to a <strong>traditional IRA</strong>. If your child does not withdraw the money right
      away and keeps it invested, it can continue growing for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if a child's Trump Account holds $50,000 at age 18 and they leave it invested at an
      average 10% return, it could grow to roughly:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>$336,000</strong> by age 38 (20 more years)</li>
      <li><strong>$2.2 million</strong> by age 58 (40 more years)</li>
      <li><strong>$5.7 million</strong> by age 65 (47 more years)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That is the power of compound growth over a long time. Social Security provides a guaranteed monthly
      check. A Trump Account provides a pool of invested money. Together, they can give your child a much
      stronger financial foundation in retirement.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      Trump Accounts and Social Security are <strong>completely separate programs</strong>. They are funded
      differently, serve different purposes, and operate at different stages of life. One does not replace
      or reduce the other. Your child will benefit from both.
