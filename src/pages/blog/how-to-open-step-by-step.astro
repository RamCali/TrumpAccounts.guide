    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Step 1: Get Your Child's Social Security Number</h2>

    <p>
      Your child must be a <strong>U.S. citizen with a valid SSN</strong> to qualify. There are no income restrictions. If your child is under 18 at the end of the election year, they are eligible.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If your baby was just born:</strong> You can apply for an SSN at the hospital when you fill out the birth certificate paperwork. Most hospitals offer this. The card arrives by mail in 2 to 4 weeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If your child does not have an SSN yet:</strong> Visit your local Social Security Administration office with the child's birth certificate, proof of citizenship, and your ID. You can find your nearest office at <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/locator/">ssa.gov/locator</a>.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Pro tip">
      Apply for the SSN as early as possible. You cannot file {limits.form} without it, and delays could mean missing out on months of compounding growth.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Step 2: Download IRS Form 4547</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>{limits.form}</strong> is the official "Trump Account Election(s)" form. Download it from <a href="https://www.irs.gov">IRS.gov</a> or the <a href="https://trumpaccounts.gov">{limits.portal}</a> website.
    </p>

    <p>
      The form is straightforward. It is similar in complexity to claiming a tax credit. You will need:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your child's full legal name and SSN</li>
      <li>Your name and taxpayer identification number (SSN or ITIN)</li>
      <li>Custodian designation (the parent or legal guardian who will manage the account)</li>
      <li>Your chosen eligible index fund</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Fill Out the Form</h2>

    <p>
      The form has a few sections. Here is what each one asks for:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Child information:</strong> Name, SSN, and date of birth. The child must be under 18 at the end of the election year.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Parent/guardian information:</strong> Your name, SSN or ITIN, and address. This is the person making the election.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Custodian designation:</strong> The authorized individual who will manage investments and contributions until the child turns 18. This is usually a parent or legal guardian.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Investment election:</strong> Choose from eligible mutual funds or ETFs that track the S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index. Popular options include VOO (0.03% expense ratio), IVV (0.03%), SPY (0.09%), and SPLG (0.02%).
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Pro tip">
      Double-check every SSN digit. A typo can delay processing by weeks. If you are filing for multiple children, use a separate Form 4547 for each one.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Step 4: File Your Form</h2>

    <p>
      You have <strong>three ways</strong> to submit {limits.form}:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Option A: With your 2025 tax return.</strong> Attach Form 4547 when you file your 2025 taxes. The deadline is <strong>April 15, 2026</strong>. This is the simplest option if you are already filing taxes. Works with both paper and electronic filing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Option B: Through {limits.portal}.</strong> The online portal is expected to launch in <strong>mid-2026</strong>. This will let you file the election directly without waiting for tax season. Good if you want to file outside of tax season.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Option C: By mail.</strong> Print and mail {limits.form} to the IRS address listed on the form. This works year-round but is the slowest option.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Don't wait for the portal">
      Filing with your 2025 tax return is the fastest way to activate the account. If your child was born in 2025-{limits.pilotDepositEndYear}, the <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong> starts growing sooner when you file sooner. See our guide on <a href="/blog/should-i-wait-or-invest-now" class="text-gold-400 hover:text-gold-300">whether to wait or invest now</a>.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Step 5: Choose an Eligible Index Fund</h2>

    <p>
      Trump Accounts require investments in <strong>mutual funds or ETFs that track the S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index</strong>. You cannot pick individual stocks, bonds, or crypto.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some of the most popular eligible options:
    </p>

    <div class="not-prose my-6 overflow-x-auto">
      <table class="w-full text-sm">
        <thead>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-600 text-left text-gray-400">
            <th class="pb-2 pr-4">Fund</th>
            <th class="pb-2 pr-4">Ticker</th>
            <th class="pb-2 pr-4">Expense Ratio</th>
            <th class="pb-2">Index</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="text-gray-300">
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">Vanguard S&P 500 ETF</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-mono text-gold-400">VOO</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">0.03%</td>
            <td class="py-2">S&P 500</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">iShares Core S&P 500 ETF</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-mono text-gold-400">IVV</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">0.03%</td>
            <td class="py-2">S&P 500</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-mono text-gold-400">SPLG</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">0.02%</td>
            <td class="py-2">S&P 500</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-mono text-gold-400">SPY</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">0.09%</td>
            <td class="py-2">S&P 500</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Lower expense ratios mean more of your money stays invested. Over 18 years, even a small difference in fees adds up. SPLG and VOO are the cheapest options.
    </p>

    <CalculatorCTA calculator="eligibility" />

    <h2>Step 6: Set Up Contributions</h2>

    <p>
      After the account is open, you can contribute up to <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} per year</strong>. This is after-tax money. Contributions are not tax-deductible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyone can contribute: parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends. The total from all sources cannot exceed the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual cap.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your employer offers it, they can contribute up to <strong>${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong> tax-free under IRC Section 128. This counts toward the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} cap.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Pro tip">
      Set up automatic monthly contributions. Contributing about $417/month maxes out the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual limit. Even $100 or $200/month makes a big difference over 18 years thanks to compounding.

    <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>

    <p>
      Once your Form 4547 is processed, the account is active. If your child was born between {limits.pilotDepositStartYear} and {limits.pilotDepositEndYear}, the <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong> is added. Your contributions go into the index fund you chose. The money grows tax-deferred until your child turns 18.
    </p>

    <p>
      At age {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}, the Trump Account <strong>automatically converts to a traditional IRA</strong>. Your child then has full control and can use the money for anything: college, a first home, starting a business, or long-term retirement savings.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hardest part is getting started. Once the account is open, compounding does the heavy lifting. See our <a href="/calculators/growth-calculator">growth calculator</a> to project how much your child could have at 18.
