    question: 'Is a Trump Account divided in a divorce?',
    answer: 'No. The Trump Account belongs to the child, not the parents. It is not a marital asset and should not be divided in divorce proceedings. The account stays intact in the child\'s name.',

    question: 'Who controls the Trump Account after a divorce?',
    answer: 'The custody arrangement typically determines who serves as the authorized individual. A court may designate which parent manages the account as part of the custody agreement.',

  {
    question: 'Can both parents still contribute after a divorce?',
    answer: `Yes. Both parents can continue contributing to the child's Trump Account. The combined total from all sources still cannot exceed $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} per year.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can a spouse use the Trump Account balance in settlement negotiations?',
    answer: 'No. Since the account is the child\'s property, not the parent\'s, it should not be part of any marital property settlement. An attorney can help protect the account during proceedings.',

    <p>
      Divorce is stressful enough without worrying about your child's financial future. If you and your spouse have a Trump Account for your child, here is the good news: <strong>the account is protected</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Account Belongs to the Child</h2>
    <p>
      This is the most important thing to understand. A Trump Account is <strong>the child's property</strong>. It is not your asset. It is not your spouse's asset. It is your child's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under IRC Section 530A, the account is established for the benefit of the child. The <a href="/blog/who-controls-trump-account">authorized individual</a> (parent or guardian) manages it, but they do not own it.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="Not a marital asset">
      <p>
        A Trump Account should <strong>not</strong> be included in the division of marital property. If your divorce attorney or your spouse's attorney tries to include it, make sure they understand this is the child's account, not yours.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>What Changes in a Divorce</h2>
    <p>
      While the account itself stays untouched, the <strong>management structure</strong> may change:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The authorized individual may change.</strong> If custody shifts, the court may designate the custodial parent as the new authorized individual who manages the account.</li>
      <li><strong>Court orders may specify management.</strong> A divorce decree or custody agreement can include language about who manages the Trump Account going forward.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key point is that <strong>only the manager changes — not the account</strong>. The child's balance, investments, and growth continue exactly as before.
    </p>

    <h2>Both Parents Can Still Contribute</h2>
    <p>
      Divorce does not change the contribution rules. Both parents — and grandparents, relatives, or anyone else — can continue to contribute to the child's Trump Account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>combined annual limit of ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}</strong> still applies across all contributors. If Mom contributes $3,000 and Dad contributes $2,000, the cap is reached for that year.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Coordinate contributions">
      <p>
        After a divorce, communication about contributions can be harder. Consider agreeing in the divorce settlement on how much each parent will contribute annually, so you do not accidentally exceed the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} limit.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Protecting the Account During Divorce</h2>
    <p>
      Here are practical steps to make sure your child's Trump Account is handled correctly:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tell your attorney it is a child's account.</strong> Make sure your lawyer understands that this is not a 401(k) or IRA that belongs to a spouse. It is the child's property under IRC Section 530A.</li>
      <li><strong>Include management terms in the decree.</strong> Specify which parent will be the authorized individual. This prevents future disputes.</li>
      <li><strong>Set contribution agreements in writing.</strong> Decide how much each parent will contribute so the total stays within limits.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep the account out of settlement math.</strong> The Trump Account balance should not be used as leverage in negotiating the division of assets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What About Creditors in a Divorce?</h2>
    <p>
      If one parent has debts that come up during divorce, those debts <strong>cannot be satisfied from the child's Trump Account</strong>. The account belongs to the child. Creditors of the parents have no claim to it.
