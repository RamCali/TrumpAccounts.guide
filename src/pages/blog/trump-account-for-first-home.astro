    question: 'Can I use a Trump Account for a house down payment?',
    answer: `Yes. At age 18, the Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA. The IRS allows up to $10,000 in penalty-free withdrawals for a first-time home purchase. You still owe ordinary income tax on the withdrawal, but the 10% early withdrawal penalty is waived on the first $10,000.`,

  {
    question: 'What is the first-time homebuyer exception for IRAs?',
    answer: 'The IRS allows a lifetime maximum of $10,000 in penalty-free IRA withdrawals for a first-time home purchase. "First-time" means you (or your spouse) have not owned a home in the previous two years. The withdrawal is still taxed as ordinary income.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can both spouses use the $10,000 homebuyer exception?',
    answer: 'Yes. If both spouses qualify as first-time homebuyers and each has an IRA (including a converted Trump Account), they can each withdraw up to $10,000 penalty-free — for a combined $20,000 toward the home purchase.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I need more than $10,000 from my Trump Account for a home?',
    answer: 'Any withdrawal beyond $10,000 faces the standard 10% early withdrawal penalty (in addition to ordinary income tax) if you are under age 59.5. For example, withdrawing $30,000 would mean $10,000 is penalty-free and $20,000 faces the 10% penalty ($2,000).',

    <p>
      Buying a first home is one of the most practical uses of Trump Account funds. Thanks to the <strong>first-time homebuyer IRA exception</strong>, your child can pull out up to $10,000 without the usual 10% penalty. Here is exactly how it works.
    </p>

    <h2>The First-Time Homebuyer Exception</h2>
    <p>
      At age {limits.iraConversionAge}, the Trump Account becomes a traditional IRA. The IRS has a special rule for traditional IRAs: you can withdraw up to <strong>$10,000 in your lifetime</strong> for a first-time home purchase without paying the 10% early withdrawal penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a <strong>lifetime limit</strong>, not an annual limit. Once you use it, it is gone.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="What counts as 'first-time'?">
      <p>
        The IRS defines a "first-time homebuyer" as someone who has <strong>not owned a principal residence in the previous two years</strong>. This means someone who owned a home years ago but has been renting recently could still qualify. It does not have to be your very first home ever.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>What You Pay: A Real Example</h2>
    <p>
      Let's say your child's Trump Account is worth <strong>$80,000</strong> at age 18. They want to use <strong>$10,000</strong> as a down payment on their first home at age 22. Here is the cost:
    </p>

    <div class="not-prose my-6 overflow-x-auto">
      <table class="w-full border-collapse text-sm">
        <thead>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-600 text-left">
            <th class="py-3 pr-4 text-gray-400 font-medium">Item</th>
            <th class="py-3 text-gray-400 font-medium">Amount</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="text-gray-300">
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-3 pr-4">Withdrawal for down payment</td>
            <td class="py-3 font-medium text-white">$10,000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-3 pr-4">Federal income tax (12% bracket)</td>
            <td class="py-3 font-medium text-amber-300">$1,200</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-3 pr-4">10% early withdrawal penalty</td>
            <td class="py-3 font-medium text-mint-300">$0 (homebuyer exception)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="py-3 pr-4 font-medium">Net cash for down payment</td>
            <td class="py-3 font-bold text-white">$8,800</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Your child gets <strong>$8,800</strong> toward their home after taxes. Without the homebuyer exception, the 10% penalty would take another $1,000, leaving only $7,800.
    </p>

    <h2>What If You Need More Than $10,000?</h2>
    <p>
      The $10,000 limit only applies to the penalty exemption. Your child can withdraw more, but anything above $10,000 faces the <strong>10% early withdrawal penalty</strong> plus ordinary income tax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is what a <strong>$30,000 withdrawal</strong> looks like (at a 12% tax bracket):
    </p>

    <div class="not-prose my-6 overflow-x-auto">
      <table class="w-full border-collapse text-sm">

        <tbody class="text-gray-300">
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">

          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-3 pr-4 font-medium text-white">Next $20,000</td>
            <td class="py-3 pr-4">$2,400</td>
            <td class="py-3 pr-4 text-amber-300">$2,000</td>
            <td class="py-3">$4,400</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="py-3 pr-4 font-medium text-white">Total $30,000</td>
            <td class="py-3 pr-4">$3,600</td>
            <td class="py-3 pr-4">$2,000</td>
            <td class="py-3 font-bold text-amber-300">$5,600</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Out of a $30,000 withdrawal, your child keeps <strong>$24,400</strong> after taxes and penalties.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="The 10% penalty adds up fast">
      <p>
        On amounts above $10,000, the combined cost of income tax plus the 10% penalty can eat nearly a quarter of the withdrawal. Think carefully about how much to take out versus how much to leave invested.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Combining With a Spouse</h2>
    <p>
      If your child marries someone who also has a traditional IRA (including a converted Trump Account), <strong>both spouses can each use the $10,000 exception</strong>. That means up to <strong>$20,000 combined</strong> in penalty-free home purchase withdrawals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both spouses must qualify as first-time homebuyers (no home ownership in the past two years). The funds must be used within <strong>120 days</strong> of withdrawal for the home purchase.
    </p>

    <h2>Strategy: Keep Most of It Invested</h2>
    <p>
      An $80,000 account at age 18 is a powerful asset. Withdrawing $10,000 for a home still leaves <strong>$70,000 growing</strong> in the IRA. At 8% average returns, that $70,000 could grow to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>$151,000</strong> by age 28 (10 more years)</li>
      <li><strong>$325,000</strong> by age 38 (20 more years)</li>
      <li><strong>$1,500,000+</strong> by age 59.5 (penalty-free withdrawals)</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Take only what you need">
      <p>
        The $10,000 penalty-free exception is valuable, but the <strong>money left invested is even more valuable</strong> over time. Consider using the $10,000 exception for a down payment and finding other sources for closing costs and moving expenses.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Important Rules to Remember</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>$10,000 is a lifetime limit</strong>, not per-purchase.</li>
      <li>Funds must be used within <strong>120 days</strong> of withdrawal.</li>
      <li>The home must be a <strong>principal residence</strong> — not an investment property.</li>
      <li>You (or your spouse) must not have owned a home in the <strong>past 2 years</strong>.</li>
      <li>The withdrawal is still <strong>taxed as ordinary income</strong> — only the penalty is waived.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      The first-time homebuyer exception makes Trump Accounts a legitimate tool for helping your child buy their first home. The $10,000 penalty-free withdrawal — or $20,000 combined with a spouse — can make a real difference in a down payment.
