    question: 'Can I withdraw from a Trump Account before age 18?',
    answer: 'No. During the growth phase (birth through age 18), no withdrawals are allowed except for three narrow exceptions: rollovers to another Trump Account, return of excess contributions that exceeded the $5,000 annual limit, and distribution upon death of the beneficiary.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the penalty for withdrawing from a Trump Account before 59.5?',
    answer: 'After the account converts to a traditional IRA at age 18, withdrawals before age 59.5 face ordinary income tax plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty. For example, a $10,000 withdrawal at a 12% tax rate costs $1,200 in taxes plus a $1,000 penalty — totaling $2,200.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the exceptions to the 10% early withdrawal penalty?',
    answer: 'The main exceptions include: first-time home purchase (up to $10,000), qualified education expenses, total and permanent disability, death, unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI, substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP/72t), and health insurance premiums while unemployed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When can I withdraw from a Trump Account without any penalty?',
    answer: 'After age 59.5, you can withdraw from the traditional IRA without the 10% early withdrawal penalty. You still owe ordinary income tax on all withdrawals. Required minimum distributions (RMDs) begin at age 73.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I contribute more than $5,000 in a year?',
    answer: `Excess contributions must be removed before the tax filing deadline (including extensions) to avoid a 6% excise tax on the excess amount for each year it remains in the account. The return of excess contributions is one of the few allowed "withdrawals" before age 18.`,

    <p>
      Understanding Trump Account penalties is essential for planning. The rules change at different ages, and the exceptions to the 10% penalty can save thousands of dollars. Here is the complete breakdown.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 1: Before Age 18 — The Lock-Up Period</h2>
    <p>
      During the growth phase (birth through age {limits.growthPhaseEndAge}), the Trump Account is <strong>locked</strong>. This is not like a savings account. You cannot withdraw money for emergencies, expenses, or any other reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are only <strong>three exceptions</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rollovers</strong> — transferring to another Trump Account (like switching custodians). Not a true withdrawal.</li>
      <li><strong>Excess contributions</strong> — getting back money that went over the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year annual limit. Must be removed before the tax filing deadline to avoid a 6% excise tax.</li>
      <li><strong>Death of the beneficiary</strong> — funds are distributed to the estate or designated beneficiary.</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="No hardship exceptions before 18">
      <p>
        Unlike a 401(k) or some other accounts, there are <strong>no hardship withdrawals</strong> from a Trump Account before age 18. Financial emergency, medical bills, job loss — none of these allow early access. The money stays invested no matter what.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Phase 2: Age 18 to 59.5 — Tax + Penalty</h2>
    <p>
      At age {limits.iraConversionAge}, the Trump Account <strong>converts to a traditional IRA</strong>. Your child takes full control and can withdraw funds for <a href="/blog/what-can-money-be-used-for">any purpose</a>. But every withdrawal faces two costs:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ordinary income tax</strong> — the withdrawal is added to your child's taxable income for the year</li>
      <li><strong>10% early withdrawal penalty</strong> — an additional tax on top of the income tax</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What this costs in real numbers</h3>

    <p>
      Note: large withdrawals may push your child into a higher tax bracket, increasing the effective rate above 12%.
    </p>

    <h2>Exceptions to the 10% Early Withdrawal Penalty</h2>
    <p>
      The IRS provides several exceptions where the <strong>10% penalty is waived</strong>. You still owe ordinary income tax, but you avoid the extra 10%. Here is every exception that applies to traditional IRA withdrawals:
    </p>

    <h3>First-time home purchase</h3>
    <p>
      Withdraw up to <strong>$10,000 lifetime</strong> for a first-time home purchase. "First-time" means no home ownership in the past two years. Both spouses can each use $10,000 for a combined $20,000. Funds must be used within 120 days. <a href="/blog/trump-account-for-first-home">Full home purchase guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Qualified education expenses</h3>
    <p>
      Tuition, fees, books, supplies, and room and board (if at least half-time) at an eligible institution. Covers both <a href="/blog/trump-account-for-college">colleges</a> and <a href="/blog/trump-account-for-trade-school">trade schools</a> that participate in federal student aid programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Total and permanent disability</h3>
    <p>
      If the account holder becomes totally and permanently disabled as defined by the IRS, all withdrawals are penalty-free. You must be able to provide documentation from a physician.
    </p>

    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p>
      If the account holder dies, the beneficiary or estate can receive the funds without the 10% penalty. Income tax still applies.
    </p>

    <h3>Unreimbursed medical expenses</h3>
    <p>
      Withdrawals to pay medical expenses that exceed <strong>7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI)</strong> are penalty-free. Only the amount above the 7.5% threshold qualifies.
    </p>

    <h3>Substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP / 72t)</h3>
    <p>
      Under IRC Section 72(t), you can set up a series of <strong>substantially equal periodic payments</strong> based on your life expectancy. Once started, you must continue for at least 5 years or until age 59.5 (whichever is later). This is complex and modifications trigger retroactive penalties.
    </p>

    <h3>Health insurance while unemployed</h3>
    <p>
      If you lose your job and have been unemployed for <strong>12 or more consecutive weeks</strong>, you can withdraw penalty-free to pay for health insurance premiums. This exception ends 60 days after you are re-employed.
    </p>

    <h3>IRS levy</h3>
    <p>
      If the IRS seizes IRA funds to pay unpaid federal taxes, the 10% penalty does not apply to the seized amount.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Penalty-free is not tax-free">
      <p>
        Every exception on this list waives the <strong>10% penalty only</strong>. The withdrawal is still taxed as <strong>ordinary income</strong>. The only way to avoid income tax entirely is to <a href="/blog/trump-account-retirement-conversion">convert to a Roth IRA</a> first, pay taxes on the conversion, and then make qualified Roth withdrawals later.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Phase 3: After Age 59.5 — Income Tax Only</h2>
    <p>
      Once your child reaches age <strong>59.5</strong>, the 10% early withdrawal penalty disappears permanently. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, but there is no additional penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the account has been growing since birth, this is potentially <strong>41+ years of compound growth</strong>. The balance could be substantial.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 4: After Age 73 — Required Minimum Distributions</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at age <strong>73</strong>, the IRS requires annual withdrawals from traditional IRAs called <strong>required minimum distributions (RMDs)</strong>. The amount is based on the account balance and life expectancy tables published by the IRS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure to take an RMD results in a penalty of <strong>25%</strong> of the amount that should have been withdrawn (reduced to 10% if corrected promptly). RMDs are taxed as ordinary income.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Roth conversion avoids RMDs">
      <p>
        Roth IRAs have <strong>no required minimum distributions</strong> during the owner's lifetime. If your child <a href="/blog/trump-account-retirement-conversion">converts to a Roth IRA</a> at age 18 while in a low tax bracket, they can avoid RMDs entirely and let the money grow tax-free for as long as they live.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Excess Contribution Penalties</h2>
    <p>
      If more than <strong>${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}</strong> is contributed in a single year (from all sources combined), the excess must be removed before the tax filing deadline. If not removed in time, the excess amount faces a <strong>6% excise tax for each year</strong> it stays in the account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Removing excess contributions is one of the three allowed "withdrawals" before age 18. The returned amount includes any earnings attributable to the excess, which are taxed as income.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      The penalty rules are straightforward once you understand the three phases. Before 18: locked. Age 18-59.5: taxed plus penalized (with exceptions). After 59.5: taxed only. Knowing the exceptions — especially for a <a href="/blog/trump-account-for-first-home">first home</a> and <a href="/blog/trump-account-for-college">education</a> — can save your child thousands.
