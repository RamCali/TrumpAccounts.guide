  {
    question: 'How does compound interest work in a Trump Account?',
    answer: 'Your Trump Account is invested in S&P 500 or broad U.S. equity index funds. Returns compound automatically — dividends are reinvested and growth builds on previous growth. Over 18 years, this compounding effect can turn small monthly contributions into significant wealth.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What rate of return should I expect?',
    answer: 'The S&P 500 has averaged roughly 10% per year over its history (about 7% after inflation). Conservative estimates use 6-8%. Past performance does not guarantee future results, but 18-year periods have historically always produced positive returns.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does $100/month grow to in 18 years?',
    answer: 'At 8% average annual returns, $100/month for 18 years grows to approximately $48,000. You contribute $21,600 total, and compound interest adds roughly $26,400. With the $1,000 federal deposit, the total is about $52,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does the $1,000 federal deposit earn compound interest?',
    answer: `Yes. The $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit is invested alongside all other contributions. At 10% average returns, the deposit alone grows to about $5,560 over 18 years. At 8%, it grows to about $4,000.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Trump Account growth the same as compound interest?',
    answer: 'Technically, stock market returns are not "interest" — they are investment returns. But the compounding effect is the same: your gains generate more gains. In a Trump Account, dividends are reinvested and growth compounds tax-deferred, which behaves like compound interest.',
  },

    <p>
      Compound interest is the single most powerful force behind a Trump Account. A $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit that sits untouched for 18 years does not just grow by 18 years of returns. It grows by 18 years of <strong>returns on returns</strong>. Add monthly contributions, and the numbers get dramatic.

    <h2>How Compound Interest Works (Simple Explanation)</h2>

    <p>
      Here is the easiest way to understand it:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> You have $1,000. It earns 8% = $80. New balance: $1,080.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> You have $1,080. It earns 8% = $86.40. New balance: $1,166.40.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> You have $1,166.40. It earns 8% = $93.31. New balance: $1,259.71.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Notice how the dollar amount earned <strong>increases every year</strong> — $80, then $86, then $93 — even though the rate stays the same. That is compounding. Each year's growth becomes part of next year's base.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over 18 years, this snowball effect is significant. The longer the timeline, the more dramatic the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      At max contributions ($417/month = $5,000/year), compound interest more than <strong>doubles</strong> your money. You put in $91,000 — you get back over $200,000.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Start with what you can afford">
      <p>
        Even $50/month turns the $1,000 deposit into almost $28,000 by age 18. You do not need to max out to benefit from compound interest. The most important thing is to <strong>start</strong>.

    <h2>Why Trump Accounts Compound Better Than Taxable Accounts</h2>

    <p>
      In a regular brokerage account, you pay taxes every year on dividends and capital gains. That reduces your balance, which means less money compounding. This is called <strong>tax drag</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trump Accounts eliminate tax drag during the growth phase. Every dividend is reinvested pre-tax. Every dollar of growth compounds without the IRS skimming off a portion each year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over 18 years, the tax deferral advantage adds roughly <strong>8-15% more</strong> to your final balance compared to a taxable account with identical contributions and returns.
    </p>

    <h2>The Rule of 72</h2>

    <p>
      A quick way to estimate compound interest: divide 72 by the annual return rate to find how many years it takes to double your money.
    </p>

    <div class="not-prose my-6 overflow-x-auto">
      <table class="w-full text-sm">
        <thead>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-600 text-left text-gray-400">
            <th class="pb-2 pr-4">Annual Return</th>
            <th class="pb-2 pr-4">Years to Double</th>
            <th class="pb-2">Doubles in 18 Years</th>

        </thead>
        <tbody class="text-gray-300">

            <td class="py-2 pr-4">12 years</td>
            <td class="py-2">~1.5x</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-semibold text-white">8%</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">9 years</td>
            <td class="py-2">~2x</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-semibold text-white">10%</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">7.2 years</td>
            <td class="py-2 text-mint-400 font-semibold">~2.5x</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      At the S&P 500's historical average of 10%, $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} roughly <strong>doubles twice and then some</strong> over 18 years — landing at about $5,560.
    </p>

    <h2>Compound Interest Beyond Age 18</h2>

    <p>
      Here is what many parents do not realize: the compounding does not stop at 18. The account converts to a traditional IRA, and if your child leaves the money invested, it keeps growing.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>$5,000 at age 18 → ~$108,000 at age 65</strong> (at 7% real returns, no additional contributions)</li>
      <li><strong>$50,000 at age 18 → ~$1,080,000 at age 65</strong> (same assumptions)</li>
      <li><strong>$100,000 at age 18 → ~$2,160,000 at age 65</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The 18-year growth phase is just the beginning. If your child converts to a <a href="/blog/trump-account-roth-conversion-strategy">Roth IRA at 18</a>, all that future growth is <strong>completely tax-free</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>
      Compound interest is why Trump Accounts work. The combination of a long time horizon (18 years), stock market returns (~8-10%), and tax deferral creates a powerful wealth-building machine. You do not need to contribute thousands per month. Even the $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit alone, left to compound, becomes a meaningful head start for your child.
