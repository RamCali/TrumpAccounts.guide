    question: 'Is a Trump Account the same as a traditional IRA?',
    answer: 'Not exactly. A Trump Account is a special type of IRA under IRC Section 530A with unique rules during the growth phase (birth to 18): no withdrawals, S&P 500 investment requirement, employer match, and the $1,000 pilot deposit. At age 18, it converts to a standard traditional IRA.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can my child contribute to both a Trump Account and a traditional IRA?',
    answer: 'During the growth phase (under 18), the child has only the Trump Account. At 18, when it converts to a traditional IRA, they can also open additional IRAs if they have earned income, subject to normal IRA contribution limits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does a Trump Account count toward IRA contribution limits?',
    answer: 'During the growth phase, the $5,000 Trump Account limit is separate from traditional IRA limits. After conversion at 18, normal IRA rules and limits apply going forward.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I roll over an existing IRA into a Trump Account?',
    answer: 'No. You cannot roll existing IRA funds into a Trump Account. The Trump Account is only funded through the pilot deposit, family contributions, and employer contributions.',

    <p>
      People often ask: "Is a Trump Account just a traditional IRA for kids?" Close — but not quite. A Trump Account is built on the traditional IRA framework with some important differences during the growth phase. Here is a detailed breakdown.

    <h2>What Trump Accounts Do Better</h2>

    <h3>No Earned Income Requirement</h3>

    <p>
      Traditional IRAs require earned income. A baby does not have a job. Trump Accounts solve this by allowing anyone — parents, grandparents, employers — to contribute without the child having earned income.
    </p>

    <h3>Free Government Deposit</h3>

    <p>
      Traditional IRAs receive no government funding. Trump Accounts for children born {limits.pilotDepositStartYear}-{limits.pilotDepositEndYear} receive a <strong>$1,000 pilot deposit</strong> — free money that grows for 18 years.
    </p>

    <h3>Employer Match</h3>

    <p>
      No employer can contribute to your traditional IRA. But under IRC §128, employers can put up to ${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year into an employee's child's Trump Account, completely tax-free to the employee.
    </p>

    <h3>Built-In Discipline</h3>

    <p>
      The no-withdrawal rule before 18 forces long-term investing. With a traditional IRA, the temptation to withdraw for short-term needs erodes retirement savings. Trump Accounts eliminate that temptation during the most important compounding years.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="The compounding advantage">
      18 years of forced compounding in the S&P 500 is powerful. Every rolling 18-year period in S&P 500 history has produced positive returns. The lock-in protects against panic selling during market downturns.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>What Traditional IRAs Do Better</h2>

    <h3>Investment Flexibility</h3>

    <p>
      Traditional IRAs can hold almost anything: individual stocks, bonds, REITs, international funds, sector funds, certificates of deposit. Trump Accounts are limited to S&P 500 or broad U.S. equity index funds.
    </p>

    <h3>Tax Deductibility</h3>

    <p>
      Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have a workplace retirement plan. Trump Account contributions are always after-tax — no deduction.
    </p>

    <h3>Access to Funds</h3>

    <p>
      You can withdraw from a traditional IRA at any time (with taxes and potential penalties). Trump Account funds are completely locked until age 18 — no exceptions except rollovers, excess contributions, or death.
    </p>

    <h2>The Conversion at 18: Where They Merge</h2>

    <p>
      At age 18, the Trump Account <strong>becomes</strong> a traditional IRA. From that point on, there is no difference. Your child gets:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Full investment flexibility (any asset class)</li>
      <li>Ability to withdraw (with penalties before 59.5)</li>
      <li>Option to convert to a Roth IRA</li>
      <li>Standard IRA contribution limits going forward</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Think of a Trump Account as a traditional IRA with <strong>training wheels and a head start</strong>. The guardrails come off at 18, but by then your child has a substantial investment portfolio and years of compounded growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Should Use Which?</h2>

    <div class="not-prose my-6 overflow-x-auto">
      <table class="w-full text-sm">

          </tr>

            <td class="py-2 pr-4">Adult (18+)</td>
            <td class="py-2"><strong class="text-gold-400">Traditional or Roth IRA</strong> — Trump Account converts automatically at 18</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">Want investment control</td>
            <td class="py-2"><strong class="text-gold-400">Traditional IRA</strong> (after 18) — broader fund selection</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      For children under 18, the Trump Account is the clear winner: free money, employer match, no earned income requirement, and forced long-term compounding. At 18, it becomes a traditional IRA anyway — so you get the best of both worlds.
