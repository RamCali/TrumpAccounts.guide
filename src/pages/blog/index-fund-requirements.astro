    question: 'Can I invest my Trump Account in individual stocks?',
    answer: 'No. Trump Accounts are limited to mutual funds or ETFs that track the S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index. Individual stocks, bonds, crypto, real estate, and sector-specific funds are not allowed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the expense ratio cap for Trump Account funds?',
    answer: 'The maximum expense ratio is 0.1% (10 basis points). Most eligible S&P 500 ETFs charge far less — as low as 0.02% for SPLG or 0.03% for VOO and IVV.',

  {
    question: 'Can I use a total stock market fund in a Trump Account?',
    answer: 'Yes, if the fund tracks a broad U.S. equity index and has an expense ratio at or below 0.1%. Total U.S. stock market index funds that meet these criteria are eligible.',

    <h2>What Qualifies as an Eligible Fund?</h2>
    <p>
      Under <strong>IRC Section 530A</strong>, Trump Account money must go into a specific type of investment. The rules are simple. The fund must meet <strong>two requirements</strong>:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>It must track the <strong>S&P 500 index</strong> or a <strong>broad U.S. equity index</strong>.</li>
      <li>Its expense ratio must be <strong>at or below 0.1%</strong> (10 basis points).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Both mutual funds and ETFs qualify, as long as they meet these two criteria. You do not need to pick one type over the other.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="irs-quote" title="From IRS Notice 2025-68">
      <p>
        Trump Account contributions must be invested in "passive index funds — whether structured as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds — that track the Standard & Poor's 500 index or a broad, market-capitalization-weighted U.S. equity index" with expense ratios not exceeding 0.1%.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Eligible Fund Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some of the most popular funds that meet Trump Account requirements. All track the S&P 500 and charge well below the 0.1% cap.
    </p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      All four track the same index. The main difference is cost. Over 18 years, even small expense ratio differences add up. See our <a href="/blog/trump-account-fees-explained">fee comparison article</a> for the exact dollar impact.
    </p>

    <h2>What Does NOT Qualify</h2>
    <p>
      The rules are strict about what you <strong>cannot</strong> invest in. None of the following are allowed in a Trump Account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual stocks</strong> — No Apple, Tesla, or any single company shares</li>
      <li><strong>Bonds or bond funds</strong> — Not even U.S. Treasury bonds</li>
      <li><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> — No Bitcoin, Ethereum, or crypto ETFs</li>
      <li><strong>Real estate or REITs</strong> — No real estate investment trusts</li>
      <li><strong>International-only funds</strong> — Must be U.S. equity focused</li>
      <li><strong>Sector funds</strong> — No tech-only, healthcare-only, or energy-only ETFs</li>
      <li><strong>Actively managed funds</strong> — Must be passive index funds</li>
      <li><strong>Funds with expense ratios above 0.1%</strong> — Even if they track the S&P 500</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="No Exceptions">
      <p>
        Even if you believe crypto or tech stocks will outperform the S&P 500, you cannot put them in a Trump Account. The law restricts investments to broad U.S. equity index funds with low fees. This is by design.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Why Index Funds?</h2>
    <p>
      Congress chose index funds for Trump Accounts for three important reasons:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Low Cost</h3>
    <p>
      Index funds charge a fraction of what actively managed funds cost. The average actively managed stock fund charges around 0.6% to 1.0% per year. Trump Account eligible funds charge <strong>0.02% to 0.09%</strong>. Over 18 years, that difference saves your child thousands of dollars.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Broad Diversification</h3>
    <p>
      An S&P 500 index fund holds shares in <strong>500 of the largest U.S. companies</strong> across every major industry. Your child's money is not riding on one company or one sector. It is spread across the entire U.S. economy.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Proven Track Record</h3>
    <p>
      The S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return of roughly <strong>10% nominal</strong> (about <strong>7% after inflation</strong>) over its history. No 18-year period has ever produced a negative total return. That long-term consistency is exactly what a child's account needs.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Keep It Simple">
      <p>
        You do not need to overthink fund selection. Pick the lowest-cost option your custodian offers. SPLG at 0.02% or VOO at 0.03% are excellent choices. They all track the same 500 companies.
      </p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>How to Choose Your Fund</h2>
    <p>
      The parent (or legal guardian), called the "authorized individual" in the law, selects the fund. Here is a simple approach:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check what your custodian offers.</strong> Not every broker carries every ETF. Confirm which eligible funds are available.</li>
      <li><strong>Pick the lowest expense ratio.</strong> Since all eligible funds track the same index, the one with the lowest fee will give your child slightly more growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Set up contributions and leave it alone.</strong> You do not need to check the account daily. The fund tracks the market automatically.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can also <a href="/blog/can-parents-change-investments">switch between eligible funds</a> later if a lower-cost option becomes available. For a detailed ETF comparison, see <a href="/blog/trump-account-vs-sp500-etfs">Best S&P 500 ETFs for Trump Accounts</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      Trump Account investment rules are intentionally simple. Your money goes into low-cost index funds that track the U.S. stock market. No individual stocks. No crypto. No complex decisions. Just steady, diversified, long-term investing for your child's future.
