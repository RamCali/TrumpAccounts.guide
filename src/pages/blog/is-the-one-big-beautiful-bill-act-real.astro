    <h2>Yes, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act Is Real</h2>

    <p>
      If you have seen headlines about the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and wondered if it is real — it is. The <strong>{limits.legislation}</strong> is a federal law that was passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on <strong>July 4, 2025</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name sounds unusual, which is why many people assume it is fake, satirical, or a social media hoax. It is none of those things. It is a real law, codified in federal statute, with real IRS guidance and real money being deposited into children's investment accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>Proof the OBBBA Is Real</h2>

    <p>
      Here are the official, verifiable sources that confirm the law exists:
    </p>

    <h3>1. The Law Itself (Congress.gov)</h3>
    <p>
      The full text of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is publicly available on <a href="https://www.congress.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">congress.gov</a>, the official website of the U.S. Congress. You can read every word of the bill, see every vote, and verify its signing date.
    </p>

    <h3>2. IRS Notice 2025-68</h3>
    <p>
      The Internal Revenue Service published <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-68.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{limits.irsNotice}</a> on <strong>{limits.irsNoticeDate}</strong>. This 20+ page document provides the official IRS interpretation of how Trump Accounts work under {limits.legalBasis}. The IRS does not publish guidance for fake laws.
    </p>

    <h3>3. IRS Form 4547</h3>
    <p>
      The IRS created <strong>{limits.form}</strong>, officially titled "Trump Account Election(s)." This is a real IRS form with a real form number. You can download it from IRS.gov.
    </p>

    <h3>4. trumpaccounts.gov</h3>
    <p>
      The federal government created <a href="https://trumpaccounts.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{limits.portal}</a>, an official .gov domain dedicated to Trump Account information. The .gov domain suffix is controlled by the U.S. government and cannot be used by private parties.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="The .gov domain is the key">
      Any website ending in .gov is operated by the U.S. government. The existence of trumpaccounts.gov is independent confirmation that this is a real federal program. Scammers cannot create .gov domains.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>What the OBBBA Actually Does</h2>

    <p>
      The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a comprehensive federal law that covers many policy areas. The section relevant to Trump Accounts is <strong>{limits.legalBasis}</strong>, which:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Creates <strong>Trump Accounts</strong> — tax-deferred investment accounts for U.S. citizen children under 18.</li>
      <li>Authorizes a <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal pilot deposit</strong> for children born January 1, {limits.pilotDepositStartYear} through December 31, {limits.pilotDepositEndYear}.</li>
      <li>Sets the <strong>annual contribution limit at ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}</strong> (indexed for inflation after {limits.inflationIndexStartYear}).</li>
      <li>Allows <strong>employer contributions up to ${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong> per employee, tax-free under IRC §128.</li>
      <li>Requires investments in <strong>{limits.investmentRequirement.toLowerCase()}</strong>.</li>
      <li>Mandates that the account <strong>converts to a traditional IRA at age {limits.iraConversionAge}</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why People Think It Is Fake</h2>

    <p>
      There are a few reasons people are skeptical:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The name:</strong> "One Big Beautiful Bill" sounds informal for federal legislation. But Congress has passed bills with informal names before (e.g., the "CARES Act," the "SECURE Act").</li>
      <li><strong>Free money:</strong> A $1,000 government deposit sounds too good to be true. But the U.S. has precedent for similar programs (stimulus checks, child tax credits, earned income credits).</li>
      <li><strong>Social media misinformation:</strong> Viral posts about the law often include incorrect details, making the whole thing seem unreliable. Always check official sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Scams using the name:</strong> Scammers have created fake "Trump Account" websites and applications. These scams are real, but the underlying law is also real. Only use official IRS forms and .gov websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="warning" title="Watch out for scams">
      The law is real, but scams targeting confused parents are also real. Never pay money to "apply" for a Trump Account. Never give banking information to a third party claiming to process your deposit. The only legitimate way to open a Trump Account is through IRS Form 4547, filed directly with the IRS.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>How to Verify It Yourself</h2>

    <p>
      If you want to independently verify that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Trump Accounts are real, here is what to check:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Go to <a href="https://www.congress.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">congress.gov</a></strong> and search for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Read the bill text, especially IRC Section 530A.</li>
      <li><strong>Go to <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">irs.gov</a></strong> and search for "Notice 2025-68" or "Form 4547." Download and read the official IRS documents.</li>
      <li><strong>Visit <a href="https://trumpaccounts.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trumpaccounts.gov</a></strong> — this is an official .gov domain, confirming government operation.</li>
      <li><strong>Consult a tax professional.</strong> Any CPA or tax attorney can confirm the law exists and advise you on filing.</li>
    </ol>
