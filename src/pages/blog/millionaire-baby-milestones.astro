    question: 'Can a Trump Account really create a millionaire?',
    answer: 'Yes, but it takes time. At $417/month (the max) with 8% average returns, the account reaches roughly $100K by age 18. If left untouched in the IRA after 18 with no further contributions, compound growth alone can push it past $1 million by the early 40s. At 10% returns, it happens even sooner.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I can only contribute $100/month?',
    answer: `At $100/month with 8% returns, the account reaches about $43,000 by age 18. Getting to $1M would take until the late 50s or early 60s without additional IRA contributions after 18. Any amount helps — the key is starting early.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Are these projections guaranteed?',
    answer: 'No. All projections assume a constant average return, which does not reflect real market behavior. Actual returns will vary year to year. However, the S&P 500 has historically averaged about 10% annually over long periods. These projections use a more conservative 8% estimate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to the account at 18?',
    answer: `At 18, the Trump Account converts to a traditional IRA. Your child gains full control and can continue growing the account, convert to a Roth IRA, or make withdrawals (subject to taxes and potential penalties before age 59&frac12;).`,
  },

      What if the greatest gift you could give your child is not a toy, a car, or even a college fund &mdash; but a head start that turns into generational wealth? Here is exactly when a Trump Account hits each major milestone.

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Post-18 projections assume no new contributions">
      After age 18, the account converts to a traditional IRA. These projections assume the IRA grows at 8% annually with no additional contributions after 18. If your child continues contributing to the IRA, milestones are reached even sooner.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>What Each Milestone Means</h2>

    <h3>$50,000 &mdash; College Fund</h3>
    <p>
      At $250/month, the account reaches $50K around age 12. By 18, it could be well over $80K. That is enough to cover a significant portion of in-state tuition at most public universities.
    </p>

    <h3>$100,000 &mdash; Life Launch Fund</h3>
    <p>
      A six-figure nest egg at 18 or shortly after gives your child options: college without crushing debt, a down payment on a first home, or seed money for a business.
    </p>

    <h3>$500,000 &mdash; Financial Security</h3>
    <p>
      Half a million dollars in a traditional IRA in your late 30s puts your child decades ahead of most Americans in retirement savings. The median retirement savings for 35-44 year olds is under $60,000.
    </p>

    <h3>$1,000,000 &mdash; Generational Wealth</h3>
    <p>
      Hitting $1M before age 50 &mdash; from a $1,000 seed planted at birth &mdash; is the definition of generational wealth creation. It started with a government deposit and a parent who made a 30-minute decision.
    </p>

    <h2>The Caveats</h2>

    <p>
      These projections are illustrative, not guaranteed. Real-world considerations include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Market volatility:</strong> The S&P 500 does not return a smooth 8% every year. Some years it drops 20-30%. Over 18+ years, it has always recovered, but the path is bumpy.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> $1M in 2065 will not have the same purchasing power as $1M today. At 3% inflation, it would be equivalent to roughly $330,000 in today's dollars.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Withdrawals from the traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income. A Roth conversion at 18 (while in a low tax bracket) could eliminate this.</li>
    </ul>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Roth conversion at 18">
      When the account converts to a traditional IRA at 18, your child can convert it to a Roth IRA. If they have little to no income (like most 18-year-olds), the tax bill on the conversion could be minimal. After that, all future growth is tax-free.

    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>
      A Trump Account is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It is a get-rich-slowly machine, powered by compound interest and time. The ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit is the seed. Your monthly contributions are the water. Eighteen years of patience is the sunshine. And the result could change your child's financial trajectory forever.
