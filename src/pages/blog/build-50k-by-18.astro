    question: 'Is 8% a realistic average return?',
    answer: 'The S&P 500 has averaged about 10% nominal returns over the past 100 years. Using 8% is a conservative estimate that accounts for periods of lower-than-average performance. Actual results will vary year to year.',

    answer: 'Even in the worst 18-year periods in S&P 500 history, the market still produced positive returns. At a lower rate like 6%, you would need to contribute more per month to reach $50,000. The table in this article shows projections at different rates.',

    question: 'Can I contribute more than $5,000 per year?',

    question: 'Does the $1,000 federal deposit count toward the $5,000 limit?',

        <li><strong class="text-white">$200/month</strong> plus the $1,000 deposit at 8% returns reaches roughly <strong class="text-white">$50,000 by age 18</strong>.</li>

        <li>You do not need to max out to build meaningful wealth for your child.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      $50,000 by age 18. It sounds like a lot. But with a Trump Account, the math is surprisingly straightforward. You do not need a huge income. You do not need to max out contributions. You just need to <strong>start early and stay consistent</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's break down the exact numbers.
    </p>

    <h2>The Formula</h2>

    <p>
      A Trump Account has three sources of growth:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>The ${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong> (for children born {limits.pilotDepositStartYear}-{limits.pilotDepositEndYear})</li>
      <li><strong>Your monthly contributions</strong> (up to ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year total)</li>
      <li><strong>Compound investment returns</strong> from S&P 500 index funds</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We will use <strong>8% average annual returns</strong> as our baseline. This is conservative. The S&P 500 has historically averaged about 10% nominal returns. But using 8% gives us a realistic, slightly cautious projection.
    </p>

    <h2>The $50K Path: $200/Month</h2>

    <p>
      Here is the scenario that reaches roughly $50,000 by age 18:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Starting balance:</strong> $1,000 (federal deposit)</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly contribution:</strong> $200</li>
      <li><strong>Average annual return:</strong> 8%</li>
      <li><strong>Time horizon:</strong> 18 years</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You contribute <strong>$44,200 total</strong> over 18 years. Compound growth adds roughly <strong>$6,200 or more</strong> on top. That is free money from the market doing its job.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="info" title="Why the growth looks small at first">
      Compounding is back-loaded. In the first few years, your contributions are doing most of the work. By years 15-18, growth accelerates dramatically. This is exactly why starting early matters so much.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>What If I Can Contribute More or Less?</h2>

    <p>
      Not everyone can do $200/month. And some families can do more. Here is what different contribution levels produce at <strong>8% average returns</strong> with the <strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} deposit</strong>:

    <p>
      Even <strong>$50/month</strong> builds nearly $16,000 by age 18. That is a meaningful head start for any young adult.
    </p>

    <h2>What About Different Return Rates?</h2>

    <p>
      No one can predict exact market returns. Here is how the $200/month scenario looks at different average annual return rates:
    </p>

    <div class="not-prose my-6 overflow-x-auto">
      <table class="w-full text-sm">
        <thead>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-600 text-left text-gray-400">
            <th class="pb-2 pr-4">Average Return</th>
            <th class="pb-2 pr-4">Value at 18</th>
            <th class="pb-2">Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="text-gray-300">
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">6%</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">$44,950</td>
            <td class="py-2">Conservative (below historical average)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700 bg-gold-400/5">
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-medium text-gold-400">8%</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4 font-bold text-gold-400">~$50,423</td>
            <td class="py-2">Moderate (our baseline)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="border-b border-surface-700">
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">10%</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">$56,870</td>
            <td class="py-2">Historical S&P 500 average</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">12%</td>
            <td class="py-2 pr-4">$64,600</td>
            <td class="py-2">Optimistic (above average periods)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Even at a conservative <strong>6% return</strong>, you still build close to $45,000. The strategy works across a wide range of market conditions because of the long time horizon.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" title="The power of starting early">
      A dollar invested at birth has 18 full years to compound. A dollar invested at age 10 has only 8. That first dollar is worth roughly 4 times more than the later one at 8% returns. Front-load your contributions if possible.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h2>Breaking Down the Growth</h2>

    <p>
      Where does the $50,000 actually come from? At $200/month and 8% returns:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit</strong> &mdash; grows to roughly $4,000 on its own</li>
      <li><strong>$43,200 in your contributions</strong> ($200 x 12 months x 18 years)</li>
      <li><strong>~$3,200 in compound growth</strong> on your contributions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The growth percentage increases over time. In the first year, growth is just a few percent of your total. By year 18, compound returns are adding thousands per year. This is the classic "hockey stick" curve of compound interest.
    </p>

    <h2>Can Employer Contributions Help?</h2>

    <p>
      Yes. If your employer participates, they can contribute up to <strong>${limits.employerContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year</strong> per employee, tax-free under IRC Section 128. This counts toward the ${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()} annual cap.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your employer contributes $2,500 and you contribute $2,500, you hit the max without paying the full amount yourself. That is like getting a 50% match on your child's future.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>
      Building $50,000 by age 18 does not require a big salary or risky bets. It requires <strong>$200/month, 18 years, and patience</strong>. The S&P 500 does the rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      If $200 is too much right now, start with what you can. Even $50/month builds a real financial foundation. You can always increase later.
