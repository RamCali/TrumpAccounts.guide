      <h1>About TrumpAccounts.guide</h1>

      <p>
        We started TrumpAccounts.guide because IRS documents shouldn't require a law degree to understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the One Big Beautiful Bill Act created Trump Accounts (IRC §530A) on July 4, 2025,
        it introduced a powerful new savings tool for American families. But like most tax law,
        the details are buried in dense legal language that most parents don't have time to decode.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Translate IRS guidance into plain English.</strong> Every article we publish takes the
        official IRS language and breaks it down so a tired parent can understand it over morning coffee.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explain:</strong> We translate IRS Notice 2025-68 and Section 530A into clear, simple language</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate:</strong> Our free, interactive tools help you see exactly what a Trump Account means for your family</li>
        <li><strong>Compare:</strong> We show how Trump Accounts stack up against 529 plans, Roth IRAs, and custodial accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Update:</strong> As the IRS releases new guidance, we update our content and note the date</li>
      </ul>
