    question: 'Does inflation affect Trump Account growth?',
    answer: 'Yes, but Trump Accounts are invested in S&P 500 index funds, which historically outpace inflation by a wide margin. The S&P 500 has averaged roughly 10% annually, while inflation averages 2-3%. Your real (inflation-adjusted) return is around 7-8%.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does inflation erode a savings account?',
    answer: `At ${(limits.defaultInflationRate * 100).toFixed(1)}% average inflation, $1,000 in a savings account earning 4% APY is worth only about $1,300 in purchasing power after 18 years. The same $1,000 in a Trump Account at 8% returns could be worth roughly $3,000 in today's dollars.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What inflation rate does the calculator use?',
    answer: `The default is ${(limits.defaultInflationRate * 100).toFixed(1)}% annual inflation, which is close to the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. You can adjust this in the calculator to see how different inflation scenarios affect the comparison.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Is a Trump Account better than a high-yield savings account?',
    answer: 'Over 18 years, almost certainly yes. High-yield savings accounts currently offer 4-5% APY, but rates fluctuate. The S&P 500 has averaged roughly 10% over any 18-year period in its history. The trade-off is short-term volatility — stocks can drop in any given year, but over 18 years, equities have always outperformed savings accounts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What about years when the stock market is down?',
    answer: 'The S&P 500 has negative years, but over any 18-year period in its history, total returns have always been positive. Trump Accounts benefit from dollar-cost averaging — contributing regularly means you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high.',

      A savings account feels safe, but inflation slowly eats away at your money. Over 18 years, a "high-yield" savings account at 4% APY barely keeps pace with inflation. A Trump Account invested in S&P 500 index funds historically grows <strong class="text-white">much faster than inflation</strong>.

      <p>
        A savings account earning 4% with {(limits.defaultInflationRate * 100).toFixed(1)}% inflation gives a real return of about 1.5%. A Trump Account at 8% gives a real return of about 5.5%. Over 18 years, that difference compounds into 2-3x more purchasing power.
