  {
    question: 'How much does waiting one year cost?',
    answer: `It depends on contributions and returns. At an 8% average return, waiting one year on just the $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit costs roughly $80 in lost growth. With $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year contributions, the cost of a one-year delay grows to $500-$800+ by age 18.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does delay matter so much for Trump Accounts?',
    answer: 'Compound interest accelerates over time. The earlier money is invested, the more years it has to compound. A dollar invested at birth has 18 years of growth. A dollar invested at age 5 has only 13 years. That missing 5 years of compounding can mean 30-40% less money at age 18.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it too late to open a Trump Account for my 10-year-old?',
    answer: `No. Any U.S. citizen child under ${limits.growthPhaseEndAge} qualifies. While you have missed some compounding years, 8 years of tax-deferred growth in the S&P 500 is still valuable. Contributing $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year for 8 years could still grow to $50,000+ by age 18.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I wait for the trumpaccounts.gov portal?',
    answer: `The portal is expected in mid-2026. If you can file ${limits.form} with your 2025 tax return (due April 15, 2026), do that instead. Every month of delay costs your child compounding time. Use the calculator above to see exactly how much.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Does the $1,000 deposit grow even if I add nothing else?',
    answer: `Yes. The $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit is invested in S&P 500 index funds and grows on its own. At an 8% average return, it could grow to roughly $4,000 by age 18 with zero additional contributions. But the earlier the account is opened, the more time it has to compound.`,
  },

        At an 8% average return, $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year contributed from birth grows to roughly $200,000 by age 18. Starting at age 5 instead? About $130,000. That 5-year delay costs your child approximately $70,000.
