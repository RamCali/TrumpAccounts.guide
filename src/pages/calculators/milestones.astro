  {
    question: 'Can a Trump Account reach $100,000 by age 18?',
    answer: `Yes. Contributing $${limits.annualContributionLimit.toLocaleString()}/year (the maximum) from birth at an 8% average return, plus the $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit, projects to roughly $200,000 by age 18. Even $250/month gets you near $100,000.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can a Trump Account reach $1 million?',
    answer: 'Not by age 18 with the $5,000/year contribution limit. But after the account converts to a traditional IRA at 18, continued contributions and decades of compounding can reach $1 million. A $200,000 balance at 18 growing at 8% for 20 more years reaches roughly $930,000 — without any additional contributions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much do I need to contribute monthly to hit $50,000 by 18?',
    answer: `At an 8% average annual return, contributing roughly $125/month from birth — plus the $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit — projects to about $50,000 by age 18. Use the calculator above to model your exact scenario.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What return rate should I assume?',
    answer: 'The S&P 500 has averaged roughly 10% annually over the past 50+ years. An 8% assumption is conservative and accounts for fees and inflation. Use 7-8% for realistic planning and 10% for optimistic projections.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after the milestone is reached?',
    answer: 'The money keeps growing. Milestones are just reference points. At age 18, the entire balance converts to a traditional IRA. Your child can keep it invested, withdraw for major life expenses, or convert to a Roth IRA.',
  },

        The $${limits.pilotDeposit.toLocaleString()} federal deposit with zero additional contributions is projected to reach $4,000 by age 18 at 8% returns. Keep it invested in the IRA, and it could hit $10,000 by age 30 and $100,000 by age 60 — all from a single $1,000 deposit.
