    question: 'How much can an employer contribute to a Trump Account?',
    answer: 'Up to $2,500 per year per employee. This limit is per employee, not per dependent child. An employee with three children receives a maximum of $2,500 total from their employer, not $7,500.',

  {
    question: 'Are employer Trump Account contributions tax-deductible?',
    answer: 'Yes. Employer contributions to Trump Accounts are tax-deductible as a business expense. For employees, the contributions are excluded from gross income under IRC §128 — meaning they are tax-free to the employee.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do employer contributions count toward the $5,000 annual limit?',
    answer: 'Yes. The $5,000 annual contribution limit is the total from all sources — family contributions plus employer contributions. If an employer contributes $2,500, the family can contribute up to $2,500 more for that year.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can an employer contribute if the employee has no children?',
    answer: 'No. Employer contributions under IRC §128 are specifically for employees who have children with open Trump Accounts. The employee must have an eligible child (U.S. citizen, valid SSN, under 18) with an established Trump Account.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do employers report Trump Account contributions?',
    answer: 'The IRS is still finalizing reporting guidance. Employer contributions under IRC §128 will likely be reported similarly to other fringe benefits. Work with your payroll provider and tax advisor for current reporting requirements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a minimum employer contribution?',
    answer: 'No. Employers can contribute any amount up to $2,500 per employee per year. There is no minimum. Some employers may offer a flat amount (e.g., $500/year) while others may match employee contributions.',

      <h1>Trump Account Employer Contributions: What HR Needs to Know</h1>

      <p>
        The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created a powerful new employee benefit: employers can contribute
        up to <strong>$2,500 per year per employee</strong> to Trump Accounts, completely
        <strong>tax-free</strong> under IRC §128.
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Key point for employers">
        <p>Employer contributions are <strong>per employee</strong>, not per dependent child. One employee with three children still receives up to $2,500 total.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2>How Employer Contributions Work</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual limit:</strong> $2,500/year per employee</li>
        <li><strong>Tax treatment:</strong> Employer contributions are excluded from the employee's gross income under IRC §128</li>
        <li><strong>Cap:</strong> Combined employer + employee contributions cannot exceed $5,000/year per account</li>
        <li><strong>Per employee, not per child:</strong> The $2,500 limit is per employee, regardless of number of dependents</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Offer This Benefit?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recruitment edge:</strong> A unique benefit that competitors may not yet offer</li>
        <li><strong>Retention tool:</strong> Employees with children have a strong incentive to stay</li>
        <li><strong>Tax advantage:</strong> Contributions are tax-deductible for the employer</li>
        <li><strong>Simple administration:</strong> Similar to HSA or 401(k) contributions</li>
        <li><strong>Family-friendly signal:</strong> Shows commitment to employees' families</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Decide on a contribution amount (up to $2,500/year per employee)</li>
        <li>Update payroll systems to track contributions</li>
        <li>Communicate the benefit to employees</li>
        <li>Coordinate with employees' Trump Account elections (Form 4547)</li>
        <li>Report contributions per IRC §128 requirements</li>
      </ol>

      <CalloutBox type="warning" title="Consult a tax professional">
        <p>The IRS is still issuing guidance on employer reporting requirements. Work with your tax advisor and payroll provider to implement correctly.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2>Employee Communication Template</h2>

      <p>Here's a starting point for announcing this benefit to employees:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Starting [date], [Company] will contribute up to $2,500 per year to eligible Trump Accounts for employees with qualifying children. This contribution is tax-free to you under IRC §128 and helps build your child's financial future. Contact HR to learn more."
