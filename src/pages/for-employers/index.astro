      <h1>Trump Account Employer Contributions: What HR Needs to Know</h1>

      <p>
        The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created a powerful new employee benefit: employers can contribute
        up to <strong>$2,500 per year per employee</strong> to Trump Accounts, completely
        <strong>tax-free</strong> under IRC §128.
      </p>

      <CalloutBox type="tip" title="Key point for employers">
        <p>Employer contributions are <strong>per employee</strong>, not per dependent child. One employee with three children still receives up to $2,500 total.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2>How Employer Contributions Work</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual limit:</strong> $2,500/year per employee</li>
        <li><strong>Tax treatment:</strong> Employer contributions are excluded from the employee's gross income under IRC §128</li>
        <li><strong>Cap:</strong> Combined employer + employee contributions cannot exceed $5,000/year per account</li>
        <li><strong>Per employee, not per child:</strong> The $2,500 limit is per employee, regardless of number of dependents</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Offer This Benefit?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recruitment edge:</strong> A unique benefit that competitors may not yet offer</li>
        <li><strong>Retention tool:</strong> Employees with children have a strong incentive to stay</li>
        <li><strong>Tax advantage:</strong> Contributions are tax-deductible for the employer</li>
        <li><strong>Simple administration:</strong> Similar to HSA or 401(k) contributions</li>
        <li><strong>Family-friendly signal:</strong> Shows commitment to employees' families</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Decide on a contribution amount (up to $2,500/year per employee)</li>
        <li>Update payroll systems to track contributions</li>
        <li>Communicate the benefit to employees</li>
        <li>Coordinate with employees' Trump Account elections (Form 4547)</li>
        <li>Report contributions per IRC §128 requirements</li>
      </ol>

      <CalloutBox type="warning" title="Consult a tax professional">
        <p>The IRS is still issuing guidance on employer reporting requirements. Work with your tax advisor and payroll provider to implement correctly.</p>
      </CalloutBox>

      <h2>Employee Communication Template</h2>

      <p>Here's a starting point for announcing this benefit to employees:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Starting [date], [Company] will contribute up to $2,500 per year to eligible Trump Accounts for employees with qualifying children. This contribution is tax-free to you under IRC §128 and helps build your child's financial future. Contact HR to learn more."
      </blockquote>
