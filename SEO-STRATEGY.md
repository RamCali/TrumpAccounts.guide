# TrumpAccounts.guide — SEO & Content Strategy

## Positioning
**"The Translation Layer"** — We translate IRS Notice 2025-68 and IRC §530A into plain English for exhausted parents, confused employers, and overwhelmed tax preparers. Every page answers a real question with sourced facts, zero jargon, and interactive tools.

## Why We Win
1. **Dedicated domain** — trumpaccounts.guide signals intent and authority. No one else has a single-purpose site.
2. **Zero JS content pages** — Astro ships 0kb JS on articles. Sub-1.5s LCP. Google rewards speed.
3. **Interactive calculators** — Growth projector, comparison tool, eligibility checker. These earn backlinks from personal finance blogs, parenting sites, and employer benefit guides.
4. **The Translation Layer** — No one else is doing line-by-line plain-English translations of IRS Notice 2025-68. This is our moat.
5. **Employer hub** — Underserved niche. Employers are scrambling to understand §128 exclusion rules. HR blogs will link to us.
6. **FAQ schema on everything** — We own the "People Also Ask" boxes.

## Backlink Strategy

### 1. Calculator Link Bait

- Create embeddable calculator widgets with attribution links.
- Pitch to: NerdWallet, The Balance, Investopedia, BabyCenter, What to Expect, Parents.com

### 2. The Translation Layer as Original Research
- No one else is doing line-by-line IRS translations. This is citable, linkable content.
- Pitch to: tax preparation blogs, CPA firm blogs, HR/benefits publications
- Target: SHRM, BenefitsPRO, ThinkAdvisor, AccountingToday

### 3. Employer Hub as B2B Resource
- HR departments are searching for guidance. Our employer hub fills a gap.

- Create downloadable employer implementation checklist (PDF, gated for email)

### 4. Original Data & Analysis
- Create original content: "We analyzed every S&P 500 18-year rolling return since 1950. Here's what Trump Accounts could be worth."
- Original charts and infographics get linked by journalists and bloggers.

### 5. HARO / Connectively / Quoted
- Monitor for journalist queries about: Trump Accounts, children's savings, IRS changes, tax reform
- Respond with expert quotes linking back to our guides

### 6. Guest Posts
- Target personal finance blogs, parenting blogs, employer benefit publications

- Quora: Answer Trump Account questions with sourced excerpts
- Twitter/X: Share calculator results, IRS translation snippets
- Facebook parenting groups: Share eligibility checker

---

## Internal Linking Strategy

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
Each pillar page links to all its cluster pages. Each cluster page links back to its pillar and to 2-3 siblings.

### Cross-Pillar Links
- Every guide links to relevant calculator
- Every comparison links to the pillar "What Are Trump Accounts?"
- Every FAQ links to the relevant detailed guide
- Every Translation Layer page links to the related FAQ and guide
- Employer pages link to tax FAQ and glossary terms

### Contextual Link Placement
- Link in the first 2-3 paragraphs (passes more equity)
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Link to calculators with action-oriented anchors: "Try our Trump Account growth calculator"

## Competitor Gap Analysis

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses (Our Opportunity) |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| IRS.gov | Official, authoritative | Dense legalese, no calculators, bad UX |
| Fidelity/Vanguard/Schwab | Trust, brand | Product-focused, not educational, no comparisons |
| CNBC/NBC/NPR | News authority, backlinks | One-off articles, not updated, no tools |
| SavingForCollege.com | 529 expertise | 529-biased, limited Trump Account depth |
| CPA/law firm blogs | Technical accuracy | Behind paywall or jargon-heavy, no tools |
| **TrumpAccounts.guide** | **Dedicated, plain English, calculators, employer hub, translation layer** | **New domain, no authority yet** |

Our edge: dedicated domain + plain English + interactive tools + employer hub + translation layer = underserved needs that big players ignore.
