## What Are Trump Accounts?

Trump Accounts are a new type of tax-advantaged savings account created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025. Officially established under IRC Section 530A, they are designed to give every American child a financial head start.

### How They Work

1. **Federal Seed Money:** Children born January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2028 receive a one-time $1,000 pilot deposit from the federal government.
2. **Annual Contributions:** Parents (or anyone) can contribute up to $5,000/year in after-tax dollars. This limit is indexed for inflation starting in 2027.
3. **Employer Contributions:** Employers can contribute up to $2,500/year per employee (not per dependent), tax-free under IRC §128. This counts toward the $5,000 cap.
4. **Investment Requirement:** All funds must be invested in mutual funds or ETFs tracking the S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index. Expense ratios are capped at 0.1%.
5. **Growth Phase:** From birth to age 18, the account grows tax-deferred. No withdrawals are allowed (except rollovers, excess contributions, or death of the child).
6. **At Age 18:** The Trump Account automatically converts to a traditional IRA with standard IRA rules.

### Eligibility

To open a Trump Account, the child must be:
- A U.S. citizen
- Have a valid Social Security Number (SSN)
- Under 18 at the end of the election year

There are NO income restrictions — any family can participate regardless of how much they earn.

### How to Open

There are three ways to establish a Trump Account:
1. **With your tax return:** Include IRS Form 4547 (Trump Account Election(s)) with your 2025 tax return, due April 15, 2026.
2. **Online portal:** Through trumpaccounts.gov (expected to launch mid-2026).
3. **By mail:** Send Form 4547 to the IRS.

### Tax Treatment

- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars (no tax deduction)
- Earnings grow tax-deferred during the growth phase
- Withdrawals after age 18 are taxed as ordinary income
- Before age 59½, a 10% early withdrawal penalty applies (standard IRA rules)
- Exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty include: first home purchase ($10,000 lifetime), qualified education expenses, disability, and certain medical expenses

### The Dell Foundation Pledge

Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion — $250 per child under 10 in ZIP codes where the median household income is below $150,000. This is in addition to the $1,000 federal pilot deposit.

## Trump Account vs Other Savings Accounts

### Trump Account vs 529 Plan
- Trump Account: $5,000/year limit, S&P 500 only, converts to traditional IRA at 18, can be used for anything
- 529 Plan: Higher limits ($16,000+ gift tax exclusion), flexible investment options, tax-free for education, 10% penalty on non-education withdrawals
- Key difference: Trump Accounts have no usage restrictions after 18; 529s must be used for education

### Trump Account vs Roth IRA
- Trump Account: No income limit, no earned income needed, $5,000/year, S&P 500 only, traditional IRA tax treatment
- Roth IRA: Income limits apply, requires earned income, $7,000/year (2025), any investment, tax-free withdrawals
- Key difference: Trump Accounts are for children with no earned income requirement; Roth IRAs require earned income

### Trump Account vs Custodial Account (UTMA/UGMA)
- Trump Account: Tax-deferred, S&P 500 only, locked until 18, no kiddie tax
- UTMA/UGMA: Taxed annually (kiddie tax), any investment, no restrictions on use at age of majority
- Key difference: Trump Accounts avoid kiddie tax; custodial accounts offer more investment flexibility

### Trump Account vs Coverdell ESA
- Trump Account: $5,000/year, no income limit, S&P 500 only, converts to IRA at 18
- Coverdell ESA: $2,000/year, income limits ($110K single/$220K joint), any investment, education expenses only, must be used by age 30
- Key difference: Trump Accounts have higher limits and no income restrictions
