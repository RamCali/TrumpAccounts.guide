## What Are Trump Accounts?

Trump Accounts are a new type of tax-advantaged savings account created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025. Officially established under IRC Section 530A, they are designed to give every American child a financial head start.

### How They Work

1. **Federal Seed Money:** Children born January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2028 receive a one-time $1,000 pilot deposit from the federal government.
2. **Annual Contributions:** Parents (or anyone) can contribute up to $5,000/year in after-tax dollars. This limit is indexed for inflation starting in 2027.
3. **Employer Contributions:** Employers can contribute up to $2,500/year per employee (not per dependent), tax-free under IRC §128. This counts toward the $5,000 cap.
4. **Investment Requirement:** All funds must be invested in mutual funds or ETFs tracking the S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index. Expense ratios are capped at 0.1%.
5. **Growth Phase:** From birth to age 18, the account grows tax-deferred. No withdrawals are allowed (except rollovers, excess contributions, or death of the child).
6. **At Age 18:** The Trump Account automatically converts to a traditional IRA with standard IRA rules.

### Eligibility

To open a Trump Account, the child must be:
- A U.S. citizen
- Have a valid Social Security Number (SSN)
- Under 18 at the end of the election year

There are NO income restrictions — any family can participate regardless of how much they earn.

### How to Open

There are three ways to establish a Trump Account:
1. **With your tax return:** Include IRS Form 4547 (Trump Account Election(s)) with your 2025 tax return, due April 15, 2026.
2. **Online portal:** Through trumpaccounts.gov (expected to launch mid-2026).
3. **By mail:** Send Form 4547 to the IRS.

### Tax Treatment

- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars (no tax deduction)
- Earnings grow tax-deferred during the growth phase
- Withdrawals after age 18 are taxed as ordinary income
- Before age 59½, a 10% early withdrawal penalty applies (standard IRA rules)
- Exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty include: first home purchase ($10,000 lifetime), qualified education expenses, disability, and certain medical expenses

### The Dell Foundation Pledge

Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion — $250 per child under 10 in ZIP codes where the median household income is below $150,000. This is in addition to the $1,000 federal pilot deposit. This is the largest known private commitment tied to the program. A qualifying newborn born 2025-2028 in an eligible ZIP code could start with $1,250 total ($1,000 federal + $250 Dell).

## Trump Accounts for Newborns (2025-2028)

Children born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028 receive a special benefit: a one-time $1,000 federal pilot deposit into their Trump Account. This is free money from the government — no repayment, no strings attached.

### How to Claim the $1,000 Deposit for Your Newborn

1. Get your baby's Social Security number (apply at the hospital with the birth certificate).
2. File IRS Form 4547 (Trump Account Election(s)) with your 2025 tax return (due April 15, 2026), or submit through trumpaccounts.gov when the portal launches mid-2026.
3. The $1,000 is deposited into your child's Trump Account. It is not automatic — you must opt in.

### Growth Projections for Newborns

Starting with just the $1,000 federal deposit and no additional contributions:
- At 6% annual return: ~$2,854 by age 18
- At 8% annual return: ~$3,996 by age 18
- At 10% annual return (S&P 500 historical average): ~$5,560 by age 18

With $1,000 deposit + $100/month family contributions:
- At 10% annual return: ~$57,000 by age 18

With $1,000 deposit + $416.67/month ($5,000/year max):
- At 10% annual return: ~$175,000+ by age 18

### Newborns in Dell-Qualifying ZIP Codes

Newborns in ZIP codes with median household income below $150,000 also receive $250 from the Dell Foundation, for a $1,250 starting balance. At 10% annual return, $1,250 grows to roughly $6,950 over 18 years without additional contributions.

## Trump Account Benefits

Seven key benefits of Trump Accounts:

1. **Free $1,000 Government Deposit**: Children born 2025-2028 receive a $1,000 pilot deposit at no cost to the family.
2. **No Income Limits**: Unlike Roth IRAs or many tax credits, there are zero income restrictions. Every U.S. citizen child qualifies.
3. **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Investment gains are not taxed while in the account. Over 18 years, tax-deferred compounding can add thousands compared to a taxable account.
4. **Employer Matching**: Employers can contribute up to $2,500/year per employee, tax-free under IRC §128. This is essentially free money on top of family contributions.
5. **Low-Cost S&P 500 Investing**: Funds must track the S&P 500 or broad U.S. equity index with expense ratios capped at 0.1%. This protects families from high-fee products.
6. **Automatic IRA Conversion at 18**: At age 18, the account becomes a traditional IRA. The child gets a retirement account head start that most Americans don't get until their 20s or 30s.
7. **Dell Foundation Bonus**: Qualifying children receive an additional $250 from the Dell Foundation.

### Are There Downsides?

- Funds are locked until age 18 (no early withdrawals for emergencies)
- Limited to S&P 500 / broad index funds (no individual stocks, bonds, or real estate)
- Withdrawals after 18 are taxed as ordinary income (traditional IRA treatment, not Roth)
- Early withdrawal penalty of 10% before age 59½ applies after IRA conversion
- Contributions are after-tax (no upfront tax deduction)

## Where to Open a Trump Account: Brokerage Guide

The IRS will publish a list of approved trustees (brokerages and financial institutions) authorized to hold Trump Accounts. Based on their existing IRA infrastructure and fund offerings, the following major brokerages are expected to participate.

### Fidelity and Trump Accounts

Fidelity Investments is widely expected to be among the first approved Trump Account trustees. Key details:

- **Eligible S&P 500 fund**: Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) — 0.015% expense ratio (well under the 0.1% cap)
- **Eligible total market fund**: Fidelity Total Market Index Fund (FSKAX) — 0.015% expense ratio
- **Account fees**: Expected $0 account maintenance fees and $0 trading commissions (consistent with Fidelity's existing IRA fee structure)
- **How to open**: Expected through Fidelity.com or at 200+ Investor Centers nationwide, after IRS publishes the approved trustee list
- **Why Fidelity**: Lowest expense ratios among major brokerages, strong digital platform, physical branch access, established IRA infrastructure

### Schwab and Trump Accounts

Charles Schwab is also expected to be among the first approved trustees. Key details:

- **Eligible S&P 500 fund**: Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) — 0.02% expense ratio
- **Eligible total market fund**: Schwab Total Stock Market Index Fund (SWTSX) — 0.03% expense ratio
- **Account fees**: Expected $0 account maintenance fees and $0 commissions
- **How to open**: Expected through Schwab.com or at 400+ physical branches nationwide
- **Why Schwab**: Largest branch network among discount brokerages, strong customer service reputation, competitive expense ratios

### Robinhood and Trump Accounts

Robinhood has not been confirmed as an approved Trump Account trustee as of early 2026. Important considerations:

- **Status**: Not yet confirmed. Robinhood would need to apply for and receive IRS approval as a Trump Account trustee.
- **Potential eligible ETFs if approved**: VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, 0.03% ER), IVV (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, 0.03% ER), SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF, 0.0945% ER)
- **Key concern**: Trump Accounts require mutual fund or ETF options tracking the S&P 500. Robinhood primarily offers ETFs, not mutual funds, which may limit options.
- **Recommendation**: Traditional brokerages like Fidelity and Schwab offer lower expense ratios on mutual funds and have established IRA custodian infrastructure. Consider waiting for the official IRS trustee list before choosing a brokerage.

### Fund Comparison Across Brokerages

| Brokerage | Fund | Type | Expense Ratio |
|-----------|------|------|---------------|
| Fidelity | FXAIX | Mutual Fund | 0.015% |
| Fidelity | FSKAX | Mutual Fund | 0.015% |
| Schwab | SWPPX | Mutual Fund | 0.02% |
| Schwab | SWTSX | Mutual Fund | 0.03% |
| Vanguard | VFIAX | Mutual Fund | 0.04% |
| Vanguard | VOO | ETF | 0.03% |
| iShares | IVV | ETF | 0.03% |
| SPDR | SPY | ETF | 0.0945% |

Note: All expense ratios are below the 0.1% cap required for Trump Account-eligible funds. Lower is better — even small differences compound over 18 years.

## Trump Account vs Other Savings Accounts

### Trump Account vs 529 Plan

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is a Trump Account?**
A: A Trump Account is a tax-advantaged savings account for children created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (IRC §530A). The government deposits $1,000 for children born 2025-2028, parents can add up to $5,000/year, and the money grows tax-deferred in S&P 500 index funds until age 18, when it converts to a traditional IRA.

**Q: Who qualifies for a Trump Account?**
A: Any child who is a U.S. citizen, has a valid Social Security number, and is under 18 at the end of the election year. There are NO income limits.

**Q: Is there an income limit for Trump Accounts?**
A: No. There are absolutely no income restrictions. Every U.S. citizen child with a valid SSN qualifies, regardless of family income.

**Q: How do I open a Trump Account?**
A: File IRS Form 4547 with your 2025 tax return (due April 15, 2026), through trumpaccounts.gov (launching mid-2026), or by mail.

**Q: Do all newborns get the $1,000 deposit?**
A: Only children born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028 receive the $1,000 pilot deposit. You must opt in by filing Form 4547 — it is not automatic.

**Q: What can I invest in with a Trump Account?**
A: Mutual funds or ETFs that track the S&P 500 or a broad U.S. equity index, with expense ratios capped at 0.1%.

**Q: What happens to a Trump Account at age 18?**
A: It automatically converts to a traditional IRA with standard IRA rules. The child can then withdraw funds (taxed as ordinary income) or continue growing the account tax-deferred.

**Q: How much can a Trump Account grow to?**
A: With just the $1,000 deposit and no contributions, roughly $5,560 by age 18 (at 10% returns). With maximum contributions of $5,000/year, it could exceed $175,000 by age 18.

**Q: Can my employer contribute to my child's Trump Account?**
A: Yes. Employers can contribute up to $2,500/year per employee, tax-free under IRC §128. This counts toward the $5,000 annual cap.

**Q: Is a Trump Account better than a 529 plan?**
A: They serve different purposes. 529s are tax-free for education expenses. Trump Accounts convert to a traditional IRA at 18 with no usage restrictions but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. If saving specifically for college, a 529 may be better. For general financial head start, a Trump Account offers more flexibility.

**Q: Can I open a Trump Account at Fidelity?**
A: Fidelity is expected to be among the first approved trustees. Their Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) has a 0.015% expense ratio — the lowest among major brokerages. Check the official IRS trustee list when published.

**Q: What is the Dell pledge for Trump Accounts?**
A: Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion — $250 per child under 10 in ZIP codes where median household income is below $150,000. This is private money from the Dell Foundation, not government funds.
